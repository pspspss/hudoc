The case originated in twenty applications (nos. 53036/08, 61785/08, 8594/09, 24708/09, 30327/09, 36965/09, 61258/09, 63608/09, 67322/09, 4334/10, 4345/10, 11873/10, 25515/10, 30592/10, 32797/10, 33944/10, 36141/10, 52446/10, 62244/10 and 66420/10) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Russian nationals (“the applicants”), on the dates indicated in Appendix I.2.
The applicants were represented before the Court by Mr D. Itslayev and Mr Z. Sobraliyev, lawyers practising in Russia, Mr B. Risnes, a lawyer practising in Norway, lawyers from the NGO Stitching Russian Justice Initiative (SRJI) (in partnership with NGO Astreya), lawyers from the European Human Rights Advocacy Centre (EHRAC), an NGO based in the UK, and lawyers from the Committee Against Torture, an NGO based in Russia. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.3.
The applicants alleged that on various dates between 2000 and 2006 their thirty-six relatives had been abducted by State servicemen in Chechnya and that no effective investigation into the matter had taken place.4.
With regard to Yusupovy v. Russia (application no. 33944/10), the first applicant died on 7 October 2010. The second applicant expressed her wish to pursue the application on his behalf. Given the circumstances of the case, the Court accepts that the second applicant, who is the wife of the first applicant, may pursue the application on his behalf.5.
On 31 August 2011 the applications were communicated to the Government.THE FACTSI.
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE6.
The applicants in the present cases are Russian nationals. Four of the applicants in Pitsayeva and Others v. Russia (no. 53036/08) reside in Belgium, the applicant in Ibragimova v. Russia (no. 30592/10) resides in Norway, and the remaining applicants live in various districts of the Chechen Republic, as specified in the attached table (Appendix I).7.
The applicants are close relatives of persons who disappeared in the Chechen Republic between 2000 and 2006 allegedly after being abducted from their homes by groups of unidentified men. The applicants believed that the abductors were Russian federal servicemen since they were wearing camouflage uniforms, had Slavic features and spoke unaccented Russian. Armed with machine guns, the culprits broke into the applicants’ homes, searched the premises, checked the identity documents of the applicants’ relatives and took the latter away in military vehicles, such as armoured personnel carriers (APCs), UAZ minivans or Ural lorries. Only a few of the vehicles had official registration plates. In a number of cases the registration numbers were obscured with mud. None of the applicants have had news of their missing relatives since.8.
The abductions took place in various districts of Chechnya and were primarily carried out during curfew hours late at night and early in the morning. In some cases the applicants reported that a special operation had been conducted by Russian troops in the area. Indeed, in Saraliyeva and Others v. Russia (no. 63608/09), Ibragimova v. Russia (no. 30592/10) and Abdulvakhidova v. Russia (no. 52446/10), the investigative authorities officially acknowledged that a special operation had been carried out in the area at the time of the events.9.
The applicants reported the incidents to the law-enforcement authorities, and official investigations were opened. The proceedings were repeatedly suspended and resumed. From the documents submitted it appears that the relevant State authorities were unable to identify the State servicemen allegedly involved in the arrests or abductions.10.
In their observations the Government did not challenge the allegations as presented by the applicants. However, they stated that there was no evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that State agents had been involved in the abductions.11.
The facts relevant to each individual case are summarised below. The personal data of the applicants and their disappeared relatives are summarised in the attached table (Appendix I).1.
Application no. 53036/08, Pitsayeva and Others v. Russia(a)
Abduction of Mulat Barshigov12.
At the material time the first, second, third and fourth applicants and Mr Mulat Barshigov lived in Samashki, Achkhoy-Martan District, Chechnya. Mulat Barshigov was working as deputy head of the Samashki village administration.13.
On 14 November 2002 a special operation was carried out in Samashki. The village was placed under curfew and at least three roadblocks were set up in the vicinity. A military commander’s office was located in the village.14.
According to the applicants, at 2 a.m. on 14 November 2002 five or six men armed with sub-machine guns broke into their house. The intruders, who were wearing camouflage uniforms and masks, arrived in APCs (armoured personnel carriers) and UAZ vehicles. One of them, who was unmasked, was of Slavic appearance. The men, who spoke unaccented Russian, bound and gagged the first, second, third and fourth applicants, then beat Mulat Barshigov unconscious and took him away in one of their vehicles.15.
There has been no news of Mulat Barshigov since that day.(b)
Official investigation16.
The Government submitted copies of the contents of criminal case file no. 63091 (comprising three volumes) on the abduction of Mulat Barshigov. They noted that in accordance with Article 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the documents containing personal information on the servicemen who had taken part in counterterrorist operations were not furnished to the Court. The information submitted can be summarised as follows.(i)
Opening of the criminal investigation17.
On 14 November 2002 the first applicant reported her husband’s abduction to the Achkhoy-Martan district prosecutor’s office, stating that at about 2 a.m. on 14 November 2002 unidentified masked men in camouflage uniforms had broken into their house, gagged and bound the family members with duct tape, then had beaten her husband up and taken him away.18.
On 16 November 2002 the Achkhoy-Martan district prosecutor’s office opened criminal case no. 63091 under Article 126 of the Criminal Code (abduction).(ii)
Main witness statements taken by the investigators19.
On 14 November 2002 the first applicant was questioned by the investigator. She provided a detailed account of the events, stating that she and her minor children had been bound and gagged by the abductors, who had been armed with sub-machine guns.20.
On the same day Mr N. Sh., the applicants’ neighbour, made a statement to the investigation. He said that at about 5 a.m. on 14 November 2002, one of Mulat Barshigov’s sons had come over and told him that armed men in camouflage uniforms had broken into their house, tied them up and taken his father away.(iii)
Main investigative steps taken by the authorities and progress of the investigation21.
On 14 November 2002 an investigator examined the crime scene. Samples of duct tape with fingerprints were collected as evidence.22.
On 16 November 2002 the first applicant was granted victim status in the criminal case.23.
On 10 January 2003 the investigator ordered an expert examination of the fingerprints on the duct tape collected from the crime scene.24.
On 16 January 2003 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators.25.
According to the expert’s report submitted on 24 January 2003, the fingerprints found on the duct tape were not of good quality and could not, therefore, be used for identification purposes.26.
On 25 April 2003, in response to an inquiry by the first applicant, the investigator informed her that the investigation had been suspended but the search for her husband was in progress.27.
On 18 March 2005 the deputy prosecutor of the Achkhoy-Martan district issued a progress report on the investigation. Having summarised the main steps taken by the investigators, the deputy prosecutor noted, inter alia, that there had been a “lack of cooperation between the authorities responsible for the operative search measures”.28.
On 31 May 2006 the investigation was resumed and the applicants were informed thereof.29.
On 1 July 2006 the investigation was suspended.30.
On 16 June 2007 the Achkhoy-Martan district prosecutor overruled the decision to suspend the investigation as premature, and ordered the investigators to carry out additional investigative measures.31.
In August 2007 an investigator again questioned the applicants and other witnesses.32.
On 10 June 2008 the investigation was resumed and the investigators were ordered to take basic steps. The investigation is still pending.(c)
The applicants’ complaints concerning the investigation33.
It appears from the case file that throughout the relevant period the applicants wrote to various State authorities complaining about the abduction, asking for assistance in the search, inquiring about the progress of the investigation and complaining of the delays. Their complaints included the following: a letter of 17 April 2003 to the Achkhoy-Martan district prosecutor’s office; a letter of 21 April 2003 to the Chechnya Prosecutor’s Office; a letter of 7 July 2003 to the Russian Prosecutor General; and a letter of 21 May 2008 to the Achkhoy-Martan district investigations department.2.
Application no. 61785/08, Salamova and Others v. Russia(a)
Abduction of Isa and Usman Eskiyev34.
At the material time the first seven applicants were living with Mr Isa Eskiyev and Mr Usman Eskiyev (the Eskiyev brothers) in Koshkeldy village, Gudermes District, Chechnya. Their family house consisted of two separate dwellings sharing a common courtyard. One of the dwellings was occupied by the first applicant, while the other, which had two different entrances, was occupied by the other applicants.35.
At 2 a.m. on 6 June 2003 about thirty men of Slavic appearance driving four military UAZ vehicles broke into the applicants’ courtyard. They were armed, using portable radios and wearing green camouflage uniforms. They spoke unaccented Russian. Ten masked men entered into the house. They bound the hands of the first, second and eighth applicants and ordered them to lie down on the floor. After searching the house, the intruders beat up Isa and Usman Eskiyev, seized their passports and those of their spouses and took the two brothers away. Their vehicles passed freely through a checkpoint on the outskirts of the village.36.
Later that night, the same group of men broke into the house of Mr Kaim Eskhiyev, a neighbour. They were looking for his son, Mr Dalambek Eskiyev, who allegedly belonged to an illegal armed group and who had left the village two years prior to the events. The applicants heard the men asking someone over the radio “We did not find the guilty one, only two innocent men. What should we do?” and the reply, “Never mind, take them.”37.
Isa and Usman Eskiyev have been missing ever since.(b)
Official investigation38.
The Government submitted copies of part of the contents of criminal case file no. 35006 concerning the abduction of Isa and Usman Eskiyev (comprising two volumes). They noted that in accordance with Article 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the documents containing personal information on the servicemen who had taken part in counterterrorist operations were not furnished to the Court. The information submitted can be summarised as follows.(i)
Opening of the criminal investigation39.
According to the Government, the first applicant reported the abduction of her sons by State servicemen to the Gudermes ROVD on 23 January 2004. According to the documents submitted by the applicants, they reported the abduction to the Gudermes ROVD on 15 October 2003. The applicants pointed out that the brothers had been abducted from their home at night by law-enforcement officers wearing camouflage uniforms and driving four UAZ vehicles. The applicants stressed that the abductors had threatened to kill them and had passed unhindered through the checkpoint.40.
On 3 February 2004 the Gudermes district prosecutor’s office opened criminal case no. 35006 under Article 126 of the Criminal Code (kidnapping).(ii)
Main witness statements taken by the investigators41.
On 23 January 2004 investigators questioned the first applicant, who stated that at 2 a.m. on 6 June 2003 armed men in camouflage uniforms had burst into the courtyard of their family house. She had thought that they had come, as they had previously done, to search for a certain Mr Dalambek Eskiyev, a member of illegal armed groups, and the applicants’ neighbour and relative. However, the armed men had taken away Isa and Usman Eskiyev.42.
On 9 February 2004 the second applicant informed the investigators that at 3 a.m. on 6 June 2003 she had heard some noise and thought that State servicemen were again searching for Dalambek Eskiyev. He was wanted for his involvement in illegal armed groups; therefore, servicemen had often checked his house. This time, however, they broke into the second applicant’s house. They bound her hands, ordered her to lie down on the floor and then took her husband away. She managed to unbind her hands and went outside where she learnt that the servicemen had also taken away Usman Eskiyev. The second applicant told the investigators that Isa and Usman Eskiyev might have been abducted because of their kinship with Dalambek Eskiyev.43.
On 30 June 2004 a local police officer, Mr A.N., was questioned. He stated that he had learnt about the Eskiyev brothers’ abduction the following day. He had asked their relatives to immediately lodge an official complaint, but they had refused to do so out of fear that an official inquiry would only worsen the situation. They had believed that an official complaint would make the brothers’ return impossible and had hoped that both brothers would be released once questioned and checked. He also stated that he had gone to the checkpoint and asked for information concerning the passage of the abductors’ vehicles. The police officers from the Amur Region who had been manning the checkpoint at the time had explained to him that the abductors had not gone through the checkpoint but refused to confirm that in writing.(iii)
Main investigative steps taken by the authorities and progress of the investigation44.
Investigators examined the crime scene on 26 January 2004. No evidence was collected.45.
On 9 February 2004 the second and fifth applicants were granted victim status. The first applicant was granted victim status in March 2004.46.
On 24 February 2004 the investigators asked the Gudermes district department of the Federal Security Service (“the FSB”) to inform them whether the Eskiyev brothers had been detained by their officers. A negative reply was given.47.
The investigation was suspended on 1 April 2004 and resumed on 15 April 2004.48.
The investigation was suspended again on 30 April 2004 and then resumed on 15 June 2004.49.

On 8 July 2004 the investigation was suspended again; it was resumed on 2 November 2004 and suspended again on 16 December 2004.51.
On 17 December 2004 the prosecutor’s Office of the Amur Region informed the investigators that it was impossible to identify and question the police officers who had been manning the checkpoint in Koshkeldy, as all of the relevant documents had been destroyed.52.
It appears that at some point at the beginning of 2005 the investigation was resumed, but was suspended again on 4 April 2005. Subsequently, the investigation was suspended and resumed at least five more times.53.
On 5 March 2009 the supervising prosecutor criticised the progress of the investigation and ordered that the proceedings be resumed and additional steps be taken.54.
The investigation is still pending.(c)

They had previously searched the adjacent flats and exploded a grenade near the entrance to the block. Some of the men spoke unaccented Russian, while others spoke Chechen. The servicemen were wearing military uniforms, caps and helmets with torches. They were carrying machine guns and shields. After a quick search of the flat, the men pulled Mr Ayubov’s jacket over his head, dragged him outside, put him in one of their two white Gazel minivans and drove away.57.

On 24 March 2006 the President of the Parliamentary Committee for Security and Law Enforcement wrote to the military prosecutor of the United Group Alignment (“the UGA”) and the head of the Chechnya FSB. The relevant parts of the letter read as follows:“[We] have been receiving new complaints from residents of the Chechen Republic concerning the unlawful actions of officers of law-enforcement agencies ... during the conduct of special and targeted operations in populated areas of Chechnya.Thus, on 17 March 2006 [Zayndi Ayubov] ... was beaten up and taken away to an unknown destination by unidentified men in camouflage uniforms.According to eyewitnesses, the arrest [of the applicant’s husband] was carried out in a very offensive manner, without the necessary procedural norms or an arrest warrant. It was carried out by men who had arrived in two Gazel vehicles. The neighbours had memorised part of one of the registration numbers – 132 XA.In addition, during the arrest special weapons were used, namely, stun grenades.

A group of up to twenty masked armed men in camouflage uniforms and bullet-proof vests jumped out of the vehicles and entered the house. Speaking unaccented Russian, they checked Buvaysar’s and his father’s identity documents. They told the father that they were taking Buvaysar away for an identity check. The applicant asked them whether they had come from Shali and whether they had been checking other villagers. The servicemen nodded in the affirmative. Then they put Buvaysar in the minivan and departed.118.
The applicant’s brother, Ismail Magomadov, immediately reported the abduction to the head of the local administration. Together they found out that the servicemen had driven to Shali. According to the servicemen manning the checkpoint on the outskirts of Mesker-Yurt, a convoy of two APCs and a minivan had passed through and driven in the direction of Shali.119.

Three more cars, a silver VAZ-21099, a Volga and a UAZ, parked in a neighbouring street. The cars had no registration numbers. Ten to fifteen masked men in camouflage uniforms, armed with short-barreled machine guns, broke into the applicant’s house. They spoke Chechen. The applicant thought that the intruders were policemen conducting a sweeping operation. The men grabbed the applicant’s son, Mr Said Adiyev, dragged him into their VAZ-2107 vehicle and quickly drove away.135.

The next morning at about 5 a.m. he had been woken up by the sound of gunfire. A few minutes later, armed men in camouflage uniforms had broken into the house and ordered him to go outside and lie down in the courtyard.

Mr Ko., another officer from the VOVD, stated the following:“At about 6 a.m. on 14 February 2002 ... I was told that a wounded man had been brought in ... who was lying in the corridor ... His surname was Dzhabrailov ... In the corridor I was approached by the head of the VOVD staff, Mr Su., [who] handed me a grenade and a pistol without a cartridge.

I do not know who gave those objects to Mr Su. There were no accompanying documents for either the pistol or the grenade ...The same morning, 20-25 minutes later, the head of [the traffic police office] [St.] approached and said that he had come from somewhere [where] he had been given three passports and had been asked to hand them over to me. He said that [the passports] also concerned the wounded man, Mr Dzhabrailov. I do not know who gave those passports to the officer. Upon my instructions, the passports were examined and handed over to the investigation. According to the examination record, the passports belonged to Mr Chadakhanov, Mr Yesiyev, and Mr Saraliyev. I did not see Chadakhanov, Yesiyev, or Saraliyev themselves, they were not brought to the VOVD”.164.
The relevant part of Mr Su.’s statement to the investigators reads as follows:“I do not remember the exact date but, possibly, in the morning of 14 February 2002 ... a special operation was planned for Gekhi in the Urus-Martan district, and I went with a group of others to the military commander’s office for a briefing. There was a Ural lorry parked nearby with masked men in camouflage uniforms. One of them gave me a grenade and a pistol without a cartridge and told me that the grenade and pistol had been seized at the house of the persons who had been brought to the VOVD ... I took the pistol and grenade and gave them [to Mr Ko.] ...[The man] who gave me the pistol and grenade did not introduce himself and I did not ask [his name] either.”165.
The relevant part of Mr St.’s statement to the investigators reads as follows:“In February 2002 other offices from the [VOVD] and I were preparing to carry out a sweeping operation in the area near the military commander’s office ... when [an officer from the VOVD, Mr Ses.] walked out of the office and gave me three passports ...

On 12 August 2009 the Chechnya Supreme Court quashed the decision and remitted the complaint for fresh examination for the following reasons:“According to the case file, the missing person [Gilani Aliyev] was taken away by officers of the security agencies in two APCs and UAZ vehicles.The prosecution does not dispute the above allegations [of the applicant].The only reason for refusing a victim access to the investigation file is to ensure secrecy of an investigation during the examination of a theory that close relatives may have been involved in the disappearance of the missing man.In the present case there were no such reasons to refuse the victim access to the investigation file ...”206.
On 1 September 2009 the District Court found the investigator’s refusal unlawful in part and granted the applicant’s request for access to the investigation file.11.

Application no. 30592/10, Ibragimova v. Russia(a)
Abduction of Masud Khakimov247.
At the material time the applicant, her husband and their children were living in a Red Cross refugee camp situated in the building of a former boarding school in Novye Atagi, the Shali district.248.
On 24 April 2001 a large group of armed men in camouflage uniforms arrived at the camp in military vehicles, broke in and abducted the applicant’s husband, Mr Masud Khakimov, and three other men.249.
Sometime later the Shali district military commander, Officer G.N., told the applicant that her husband had been taken away either by servicemen from special division no. 2 (Дивизия особого назначения № 2, ДОН-2) or by special regiment no. 19 of Novosibirsk (19 спецназ Новосибирска), headed by Colonel D., who lived in Omsk, Russia.250.
The applicant has not seen Masud Khakimov since his abduction on 24 April 2001.(b)
Official investigation251.
The Government submitted copies of a few documents from criminal case file no. 23131 concerning the abduction of Masud Khakimov and three others (Mr A.U., Mr M.M. and Mr A.A.). Some of the documents submitted by the Government were completely illegible, whereas others were partially legible. The relevant information may be summarised as follows.252.
On 12 July 2001 the Shali district prosecutor’s office opened criminal case no. 23131 under Article 126 of the Criminal Code (abduction).253.
On 25 July 2001 the applicant was granted victim status and questioned along with other eyewitnesses to the events. All of the witnesses gave similar statements to the effect that on 24 April 2001 a group of about fifty or sixty servicemen had arrived in several APCs and UAZ cars and broken into the building where they had been living. They had taken Masud Khakimov and three other men to the courtyard, beaten them up and taken them away in UAZ cars.254.
The investigation was suspended and resumed several times. On 9 June 2003 the supervising prosecutor ordered that the investigation be resumed, having noted, inter alia, that it had failed to question servicemen involved in a special operation conducted in Novye-Atagi on the day of Masud Khakimov’s abduction. The relevant parts of the decision read as follows:“At 2.30 p.m. on 24 April 2004 unidentified armed men in camouflage uniforms, having arrived in four APCs and four UAZ cars at the premises of a secondary school in Novye-Atagi, Shali district, detained [Masud Khakimov and three others] who were living there and took them away to an unknown destination. There is no information concerning the whereabouts of [the abducted men] ...... The preliminary investigation has been resumed and suspended repeatedly ...... It has been established that the investigation is not being conducted thoroughly ...For instance, in the course of the investigation information has been obtained from [illegible] that at 2.30 p.m. on 24 April 2001 during a special operation, officers from the Shali FSB together with servicemen from [special regiment] no. 19 of military unit no. 6749 detained four men in the settlement of Novye-Atagi on suspicion of involvement in illegal armed groups. [Different types of firearms] were found and seized from [the detained men]. All the detained men and seized firearms were transferred to the Shali ROVD. However, the identity of the men detained during the operation and the place of their detention have not been identified so far. The [documents] of military unit no. 6749 for the relevant period have not been inspected. The circumstances of the special operation and the identification of the officers of the Shali FSB who participated in the operation have not been established. Servicemen from military unit no. 6749 have not been questioned about the circumstances of the special operation, the arrest of [those persons] or [the latter’s] whereabouts”.255.
At some point the investigator examined the special operations register of military unit no. 6749. It indicated that in April 2001 a special operation had been conducted in Novye-Atagi involving thirty-eight servicemen and four APCs. As a result of the operation four men (their names were not indicated) were detained on suspicion of participation in illegal armed groups. A number of firearms and ammunition were found on them and seized.256.
On an unspecified date the investigator questioned three servicemen from military unit no. 6749. They stated that on 24 April 2001 they and officers of the Shali FSB had taken part in a special operation in Novye-Atagi. During the operation the FSB officers had detained four men on suspicion of their involvement in illegal armed groups. The commander of the military unit was also questioned and stated that although he had not taken part in the special operation in Novye-Atagi, he had learnt afterwards that during that operation the FSB officers had arrested four men who had been involved in killing soldiers of a special unit from the Stavropol region (“the OMON”). The names of the detained men had not been given by the FSB department.(c)

At around 2 p.m. on 15 June 2002 an APC without a registration plate arrived at the applicants’ house in Tangi-Chu. A group of ten armed men in helmets and camouflage uniforms broke into the house. Those of the intruders who were not wearing masks had Slavic features. Speaking unaccented Russian, the servicemen pointed their machine guns at the applicants and took Mr Aslan Yusupov outside. They took his passport, forced him into the APC and told his relatives that he would return after an identity check.277.
About ten minutes later several APCs and a white VAZ-2106 car joined the vehicle. The convoy drove away, passed freely through the Russian military checkpoint situated next to Martan-Chu, and arrived at the premises of the Urus-Martan district military commander’s office.278.
On the same day the servicemen also visited several neighbouring houses and took away Mr Ramzan Sh. along with his VAZ-2106 car.279.
Immediately after his son’s abduction, the first applicant went to the Urus-Martan military commander’s office. A woman at the gate confirmed that servicemen had arrived there in two APCs and a VAZ with two young men on board.

Main investigative steps and progress of the investigation328. Following the opening of the investigation, the investigator established that the abduction had taken place during a special operation. He drew up an action plan, the relevant parts of which read as follows:“At about 4 a.m. on 26 May 2001 during a special operation [Adam Abdulvakhidov] was arrested at his home ... by unidentified men in camouflage uniforms and then taken away in an APC without registration plates to an unknown destination ...It is necessary to take the following measures:1.
To question the relatives of [Adam Abdulvakhidov] ...2.
To identify eyewitnesses ...3.
To establish which military unit took part in this special operation”.329.
On 24 October 2001 the applicant was granted victim status.330.
In November 2001 the investigators wrote to various law‑enforcement agencies requesting information about the carrying out of a special operation on 26 May 2001 and the detention of Adam Abdulvakhidov. No relevant information was received.331.
The investigation was suspended on 16 December 2001 and then resumed on 22 December 2004. The applicant was informed only of the latter decision.332.
On 26 December 2004 the investigators examined the crime scene.333.
In November 2009 the investigators questioned several of the applicant’s neighbours, all of whom stated that Adam Abdulvakhidov had been abducted by men in APCs.334.
On 19 February 2010 the investigators questioned police officer N.S. from the Shali ROVD, who stated that the search for Adam Abdulvakhidov was still in progress.335.
The investigation was suspended and resumed several more times; it is still pending.(c)
The applicant’s correspondence with the investigative authorities336.
On 22 December 2004 the applicant was informed by the investigators that the investigation into her brother’s abduction had been resumed and that operational search measures were being carried out.337.
On 27 October 2009 following a request by the applicant, the Shali investigation department provided her with copies of certain documents from the investigation file.338.
On 3 November 2009 the applicant brought proceedings against the investigators, alleging that the investigation had been ineffective owing to the authorities’ failure to take basic steps. She asked the court to order the investigation department to resume the investigation and rectify its shortcomings.339.
On 25 January 2010 the Shali Town Court left the complaint unexamined as the investigation had been resumed on 20 January 2010. On 3 March 2010 the Chechnya Supreme Court upheld the decision.19.
Application no. 62244/10, Elbuzdukayeva v. Russia(a)
Abduction of Suliman Yunusov340.
In February 2004 Mr Suliman (also referred to as Suleyman) Yunusov was staying in the house of his friend, Mr A. Mutsayev, in Grozny. At the time, Grozny was surrounded by a number of Russian military checkpoints. The nearest checkpoint was located 300 metres from the house, at the crossroads of Pervomayskaya and Mayakovskaya Streets.341.
At around 7 a.m. on 25 February 2004 a group of twelve to fifteen armed men in camouflage uniforms arrived at the Mutsayevs’ house in an APC, two white Niva cars and a white Volga car. Another two APCs were waiting at the crossroads. The servicemen, who were of Slavic and Asian appearance, broke into the houses of the Mutsayevs and their neighbours and searched them.342.
In a neighbouring house the servicemen beat up male family members and questioned them about illegal armed groups. One of them, Musa, showed his service identity card stating that he worked at the Emergencies Ministry (Emercom). The neighbours heard the servicemen saying over their portable radios: “We have found him. We are leaving.” Meanwhile, the other group of men led Suliman Yunosov out of the Mutsayevs’ house, put him in one of their Niva cars and drove him away in the direction of Pervomayskaya Street.343.
The applicant submitted that on 25 February 2004, following the murder of a fellow military officer, the servicemen had conducted a large‑scale sweeping operation in Grozny during which they had detained Suliman Yunusov.344.
The applicant has not seen Suliman Yunusov since 25 February 2004.(b)
Official investigation345.
The Government did not furnish any documents from the criminal case file concerning the abduction of the applicant’s relative. Based on the documents submitted by the applicant and the Government’s submissions, the investigation may be summarised as follows.(i)
Main investigative steps and progress of the investigation346.
On 15 March 2004 the Leninskiy district prosecutor’s office in Grozny opened criminal case no. 30021 under Article 126 of the Criminal Code (abduction) and granted victim status to the applicant.347.
On 15 May 2004 the investigation was suspended.348.
In June 2004 the military prosecutor’s office of military unit no. 20116 informed the investigators that the involvement of servicemen in the abduction had not been confirmed and that no special operations had been carried out in the area at the relevant time.349.
The investigation is still pending.(ii)
Main witness statements taken by the investigators350.
On 16 December 2011 the applicant stated that her son had fought against the Russian federal forces during the first Chechen war and had left Chechnya at the end of the war. In January 2004 he had returned and on 24 February 2004 he had gone to Grozny to visit his friend, A. Mutsayev. On 25 February 2005 she had learnt that servicemen had abducted her son and she had gone to Grozny. The Mutsayevs and their neighbours had confirmed that Suliman Yunusov had been abducted by armed men in camouflage uniforms. She had been told that the servicemen had been looking for someone and when they had arrested her son, they had left the house saying over the radio that they had found him. The first applicant also noted that after that incident, her son’s friend, A. Mutsayev had moved to Europe.351.
On 2 January 2012 the Mutsayevs and their neighbours were questioned. Ms Z. Mutsayeva stated that Suliman Yunusov had been their neighbour and had participated in the first Chechen war against the Russian federal forces. Since 23 February 2004 he had been staying in their house. In the morning of 25 February 2004, after her husband and brother‑in‑law had gone out, armed masked men wearing camouflage uniforms had broken into their house. They had taken Suliman outside, put him in a Niva car and driven away. The men had spoken Russian without an accent and had a list of the names of persons they were searching for.352.
Several of the Mutsayevs’ neighbours made similar submissions about the events to the effect that on 25 February 2004 a group of armed men in camouflage uniforms had broken into their houses and had beaten up the male family members. The servicemen had questioned them about members of illegal armed groups and about their neighbours. Shortly afterwards, one of the intruders had informed the others that they had found the man they had been looking for and, therefore, they could leave. Afterwards, they had learnt that the servicemen had abducted Suliman Yunusov from their neighbours’ house.(c)
The applicant’s complaints concerning the investigation353.
In 2004, 2005 and 2010 the applicant requested information and assistance in the search for her son; no meaningful information was provided to her by the authorities.354.
On 1 March 2010 the applicant complained about the delays in the investigation and asked for access to the investigation file, but to no avail.355.
On 16 April 2010 in response to her complaint, the district prosecutor’s office informed her that a number of shortcomings in the investigation had been identified and the relevant authorities had been requested to rectify them. The prosecutor’s office also noted that on 13 March 2010 the special investigation unit of the Chechnya Prosecutor’s Office had taken over the criminal case.20.
Application no.66420/10, Basnukayeva and Others v. Russia(a)
Abduction of Mausyr Basnukayev, and Vakha and Shamsudi Alisultanov356.
The Basnukayevs and the Alisultanovs were neighbours. Mr Mausyr Basnukayev lived with his family, including the first to fifth applicants. Mr Vakha Alisultanov lived with his family, including the sixth to eighth applicants, and his son, Rustam. His brother, Mr Shamsudi Alisultanov, was staying at his house in April 2000.
The Basnukayevs’ house was situated about 300 metres from the Alisultanovs’ house in the settlement of Chechen-Aul.357.
In April 2000 Chechen-Aul was under curfew and surrounded by Russian military checkpoints.358.
At about 3 a.m. on 16 April 2000 approximately thirty men in camouflage uniforms armed with short-barrelled machine guns cordoned off the applicants’ houses. They divided into two groups and broke in. They had parked their APC, Ural lorry and two UAZ cars in the vicinity. Those of the intruders who were unmasked were of Slavic appearance.359.
The servicemen searched the dwellings, beat up the male members of the families and checked their identity documents. They took Rustam and Mausyr Basnukayev, and Vakha and Shamsudi Alisultanov outside. The servicemen then ordered Rustam to run back to the house without looking back. They placed Mausyr Basnukayev and Vakha Alisultanov in the Ural lorry and Shamsudi Alisultanov in one of the UAZ vehicles, and drove away towards the outskirts.360.
The applicants have not seen their three relatives since 16 April 2000.(b)
Official investigation361.
The Government submitted copies of the documents from criminal case file no. 19077 concerning the abduction of Mausyr Basnukayev, and Vakha and Shamsudi Alisultanov. The documents cover only the period between 2001 and 2004. The relevant information may be summarised as follows.(i)
Opening of the criminal investigation362.
Following the abduction of their relatives, the applicants complained to various authorities. Their complaints were forwarded from one authority to another.363.
On 6 June 2001 the Grozny district prosecutor’s office opened criminal case no. 19077 in connection with the abduction of the three men.(ii)
Main witness statements taken by the investigators364.
In June 2001 the investigators questioned the first and the sixth applicants, who provided a detailed description of the circumstances surrounding the abduction.365.
In November 2003 the ninth applicant stated that an Ingush friend of Shamsudi Alisultanov had told her that in the summer of 2000, law‑enforcement officers from Voronezh had visited him and asked questions about Shamsudi.(iii)
Main investigative steps and progress of the investigation366.
On 27 June 2001 the first applicant was granted victim status.367.
The investigation was suspended on 6 August 2001 and resumed on 29 July 2003. It was suspended and resumed several more times in 2003 and 2004.368.
In July 2003 the investigator examined the crime scene. No evidence was collected.369.
On 15 August 2003 the sixth and ninth applicants were granted victim status.370.
On 2 December 2004 the investigators suspended the investigation and informed the applicants thereof. It’s unclear whether the investigation has been resumed since. The proceedings are still pending.(c)
The applicants’ complaints concerning the investigation371.
On a number of occasions between April 2000 and December 2004 the applicants wrote to various authorities asking for assistance in the search for their missing relatives; no meaningful information was given to them.372.
On 5 October 2009 the first and sixth applicants requested access to the investigation file; the Grozny District Court granted access to the file on 13 November 2009.373.
Following the applicants’ complaint of 5 July 2010 that the investigators had failed to take adequate investigative steps, the Grozny investigations department informed them on 9 July 2010 that operational search measures were under way and that they would be kept abreast of the results of the investigative steps.II.
RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE AND INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS374.
For a summary of the relevant domestic law and practice see Aslakhanova and Others v. Russia, (nos. 2944/06, 8300/07, 50184/07, 332/08 and 42509/10, §§ 43-59 and §§ 69-84, 18 December 2012).THE LAWI.
JOINDER OF THE APPLICATIONS375.
In accordance with Rule 42 § 1 of the Rules of Court, the Court decides to join the applications, given their similar factual and legal background.II.
THE GOVERNMENT’S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONA.
The parties’ submissions1.
The Government376.
In their observations in respect of all the cases, the Government submitted that the applicants had failed to exhaust domestic remedies. They could have lodged complaints before the domestic courts about the inaction of the investigative authorities or claimed civil damages. In any case, the criminal investigations into the disappearances of the applicants’ relatives were still in progress and therefore the applications had been lodged prematurely. They also mentioned that as no final domestic decisions had been taken in respect of the applicants’ complaints, the six-month time-limit was not applicable.2.
The applicants377.
Regarding the alleged failure to exhaust domestic remedies, all the applicants, referring to the Court’s case-law, submitted that they were not obliged to pursue civil remedies and that lodging complaints against the investigators under Article 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code would not have remedied the shortcomings of the investigations. They all submitted that the only effective remedy in their cases – the criminal investigations into the abduction of their relatives – had proved to be ineffective.378.
The applicants also submitted that they had complied with the admissibility criteria concerning the six-month time-limit. In particular, the applicants in Pitsayeva and Others (no. 53036/08), Salamova and Others (no. 61785/08), Debizova and Others (no. 24708/09), Adiyeva and Others (no. 30327/09), Adiyeva (no. 61258/09), Saraliyeva and Others (no. 63608/09), Aliyeva and Dombayev (no. 67322/09), Murdalova and Others (no. 32797/10), and Elbuzdukayeva (no. 62244/10) stated that they had complained to the authorities shortly after their relatives’ abduction and had hoped that the criminal investigations initiated thereafter would produce results, just as they would in any other official investigation initiated by the authorities in the Russian Federation. They lodged their application with the Court only after they had realised that the investigation had been ineffective. In addition to their references to the case of Varnava and Others v. Turkey ([GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, ECHR 2009-), the applicants also cited, amongst others, the cases of Tsechoyev v. Russia (no. 39358/05, 15 March 2011) and Amuyeva and Others v. Russia (no. 17321/06, 25 November 2010). They pointed out that even in those cases, which concerned killings, in spite of lulls in the investigations lasting several years, the applications were deemed admissible by the Court. In addition, the applicants in Petimat Magomadova (no. 36965/09), Amirova and Others (no. 4345/10) and Yusupovy (no. 33944/10) maintained that the armed conflict in Chechnya had led them to believe that delays in the investigation were inevitable. Moreover, owing to their poor command of Russian, their lack of legal knowledge and the absence of financial means to hire a lawyer, and in the absence of domestic provisions for free legal assistance to victims of enforced disappearances, they had been unable to assess the effectiveness of the investigations. The applicants in the cases of Inalova (no. 4334/10), Ismailova (no. 25515/10), Merluyev (no. 36141/10), Basnukayeva and Others (no. 66420/10) and Viskhazhiyev and Others (no. 11873/10) stated that they had initially believed that the abductions of their relatives would be investigated in a proper manner. However, with the passage of time and the lack of information from the investigating authorities, they began to doubt the effectiveness of the investigation and started looking for free legal assistance in order to assess the effectiveness of the proceedings and then, subsequently, to lodge their applications with the Court without undue delay. In this respect they referred to the case of Tashukhadzhiyev v. Russia (no. 33251/04, 25 October 2011), in which the application was lodged with the Court eight and half years after the events in question.B.
The Court’s assessment1.
Compliance with the six-month rule(a)
General principles379.
The Court will examine the arguments of the parties in the light of the provisions of the Convention and its relevant practice (see Estamirov and Others v. Russia, no. 60272/00, §§ 73-74, 12 October 2006).380.
The Court notes that the Government acknowledged that the six‑month time-limit was not applicable to the applicants’ situations, as no final domestic decisions concerning the applicants’ complaints had been taken.381.
The Court reiterates that the purpose of the six-month rule is to promote security of law, to ensure that cases are dealt with within a reasonable time and to protect the parties from uncertainty for a prolonged period of time. The rule also provides the opportunity to ascertain the facts of the case before memory of them fades away with time (see Abuyeva and Others v. Russia, no. 27065/05, § 175, 2 December 2010).382.
Normally, the six-month period runs from the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. In its absence, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of. Where an applicant avails himself of an existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, the six-month time‑limit is calculated from the date when the applicant first became, or ought to have become, aware of those circumstances (see, among others, Zenin v. Russia (dec.), no. 15413/03, 24 September 2009).383.
In cases concerning disappearances, unlike those concerning ongoing investigations into the deaths of applicants’ relatives (see, for example, Elsanova v. Russia (dec.) no. 57952/00, 15 November 2005, and Narin v. Turkey, no. 18907/02, § 50, 15 December 2009), the Court has held that because of the uncertainty and confusion typical of such situations, the nature of the ensuing investigations is such that the relatives of a disappeared person may be justified in waiting lengthy periods of time for the national authorities to conclude their proceedings, even if the latter are sporadic and plagued by problems. However, where more than ten years have elapsed since the incident, the applicants have to justify the delay in lodging their application with the Court (see Varnava, cited above, §§ 162‑63).384.
Applying the Varnava principles, the Court recently found in the case of Er and Others v. Turkey (no. 23016/04, §§ 55-58, 31 July 2012) that the applicants, who had waited for a period of almost ten years after the disappearance of their relative before lodging their application, had complied with the six-month rule because an investigation was being conducted at the national level. The Court reached a similar conclusion in another case where the domestic investigation into the events had been pending for more than eight years and where the applicants were doing all that could be expected of them to assist the authorities (see Bozkır and Others v. Turkey, no. 24589/04, § 49, 26 February 2013, not final yet).385.
By contrast, the Court has declared inadmissible applications where the applicants waited for more than ten years to lodge their applications with the Court, and where there had been, for a long time, no elements allowing them to believe that the investigation would be effective. For instance, in the case of Yetişen and Others v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 21099/06, 10 July 2012), the applicants waited for four years after the disappearance before lodging an official complaint with the competent investigating authorities and for eleven and a half years before bringing their application to Strasbourg; in the case of Findik and Omer v. Turkey ((decs.), nos. 33898/11 and 35798/11, 9 October 2012), the applications were brought to Strasbourg more than fifteen years after the events; and in the case of Taşçi and Duman v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 40787/10, 9 October 2012), the applicants applied to Strasbourg twenty-three years after the disapperance. In those cases, as in the case of Açış v. Turkey (no. 7050/05, §§ 41-42, 1 February 2011), in which the applicants complained to Strasbourg more than twelve years after the disapperance, the Court rejected as out of time their complaints under Article 2 of the Convention for failure to demonstrate any concrete advance in the domestic investigation to justify their delay of more than ten years.(b)
Application of the principles to the present case386.
Turning to the circumstances of the applications at hand, the Court notes that the criminal investigation in each case was pending when the applicants lodged their complaints with the Court. In Pitsayeva and Others (no. 53036/08), Salamova and Others (no. 61785/08), Yagayeva (no. 8594/09), Debizova and Others (no. 24708/09), Adiyeva and Others (no. 30327/09), Petimat Magomadova (no. 36365/09), Adiyeva (no. 61258/09), Saraliyeva and Others (no. 63608/09), Aliyeva and Dombayev (no. 67322/09), Inalova (no. 4334/10), Amirova and Others (no. 4345/10), Viskhazhiyev (no. 11873/10), Ismailova (no. 25515/10), Murdalova and Others (no. 32797/10), Yusupovy (no. 33944/10), Merluyev (no. 36141/10) and Elburdukayeva (no. 62244/10), the applicants complained to the authorities soon after the abductions and introduced their applications with the Court within periods ranging from three to almost nine years after the events. From the documents submitted it appears that they maintained contact with the authorities by providing the investigators with eyewitness evidence, requesting information and asking for access to the investigation files.387.
As for the other three applications, in which the applicants applied to Strasbourg after a longer period of time, ranging from nine to ten and a half years after the events, the Court observes the following. In Ibragimova (no. 30592/10), the applicant complained of her husband’s abduction shortly after the events, then gave her statement concering the circumstances and was granted victim status in the proceedings. From the documents submitted it appears that between the opening of the investigation in 2001 and 2004 she regularly requested assistance in the search for her husband and asked for information on the progress of the proceedings. Thereafter she maintained contact with the investigative authorities. Between 2003 and 2008 they informed her on several occasions of the suspensions and resumptions of the investigation and the ongoing search for her relative. In August 2008 her disappeared husband was declared dead by the domestic court and in May 2010, nine years after the abduction, she lodged her application with the Court.388.
From the documents submitted in respect of Abdulvakhidova (no. 52446/10), it appears that the applicant complained of her brother’s abduction shortly after the events in 2001, immediately made a statement to the investigation and was granted victim status in the criminal case. She was not informed of the suspension of the proceedings in 2001, but in December 2004 the investigators informed her that the investigation had been resumed. For almost four years and ten months the applicant did not contact the authorities in writing and they did not provide her with any updates on the proceedings. In October 2009, following her request to this end, she was provided with copies of some documents from the investigation file, which enabled her to see that the investigators had not taken basic steps. Between January and March 2010 she tried to complain before the domestic courts about the inaction of the investigators and in June 2010 – nine years and one month after the abduction – she lodged her application with the Court.389.
As for Basnukayeva and Others (no. 66420/10), the Court observes, first of all, that the abduction of the applicants’ relatives took place in April 2000 and that they lodged their application with the Court ten and half years after the events. Bearing in mind its conclusions in Varnava and Others in which the ten-year time-limit concerning the investigation into the alleged disappearances occurred in the context of an armed conflict (see Varnava, cited above, §166), the Court notes the following. The investigation into the abduction of the applicants’ relatives was initiated in 2001 and in the course of the following three years the applicants gave statements to the authorities and requested assistance in the search for their missing relatives. The documents furnished by the Government reflected only the proceedings between 2001 and 2004. The correspondence between the parties between December 2004 and October 2009 was not furnished to the Court. It appears that the applicants did not contact the investigation for a period of almost four years and ten months, until October 2009 when they requested access to the investigation file. Subsequently, in August 2010 the authorities informed them that the investigation into the abduction was still in progress; however, in October 2010 the applicants lodged their application with the Court.390.
The Court notes with regret the lulls in the investigation of four years and ten months in Abdulvakhidova (no. 52446/10) and Basnukayeva and Others (no. 66420/10). However, taking into account the applicants’ submissions concerning the reasons for the delay in applying to Strasbourg, and assessing the overall conduct of the applicants throughout the criminal proceedings, along with the case-law concerning similar events in Chechnya with comparable periods of inactivity in the investigation (see, for example, Kaykharova and Others v. Russia, nos. 11554/07, 7862/08, 56745/08 and 61274/09, § 129, 1 August 2013, and Saidova v. Russia, no. 51432/09, § 52, 1 August 2013 in which the investigation was inactive for a period of more than four years and four months), the Court finds that in the circumstances of these particular cases, the delays cannot be deemed excessive.391.
Regard being had to the above considerations and given that the Government do not dispute the matter, the Court finds that the conduct of each of the applicants in respect of the investigation was determined not by their perception of the remedy as ineffective, but rather by their expectation that the authorities would, of their own motion, provide them with an adequate response in the face of their serious complaints. On their part, they furnished the investigative authorities with timely and sufficiently detailed accounts of their relatives’ abductions, assisted them with finding witnesses and other evidence, and fully cooperated in other ways. It was thus reasonable for them to expect further substantive developments from the investigations. It could not be said that they failed to show the requisite diligence by waiting for the pending investigations to yield results (see, by contrast, Açış v. Turkey, no. 7050/05, §§ 41-42, 1 February 2011).392.
To sum up, all of the applicants maintained reasonable contact with the authorities, cooperated with the investigation and, where appropriate, took steps to inform themselves of the progress of the proceedings and to speed them up, in the hopes of a more effective outcome.393.
The Court considers that investigations were being conducted, albeit sporadically, during the periods in question and that the applicants did all that could be expected of them to assist the authorities (see Varnava and Others, cited above, § 166, and Er and Others, cited above, § 60). In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that all the applications were in compliance with the six-month time-limit.2.
Exhaustion of domestic remedies394.
As regards a civil action to obtain redress for damage sustained as a result of the alleged illegal acts or unlawful conduct of State agents, the Court has already found in a number of similar cases that this procedure alone cannot be regarded as an effective remedy in the context of claims brought under Article 2 of the Convention (see Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, nos. 57942/00 and 57945/00, §§ 119-21, 24 February 2005, and Estamirov and Others, cited above, § 77). Accordingly, the Court confirms that the applicants were not obliged to pursue civil remedies. The preliminary objection in this regard is thus dismissed.395.
As regards criminal-law remedies, the Court observes that in a recent judgment it concluded that the ineffective investigation of disappearances that occurred in Chechnya between 2000 and 2006 constitutes a systemic problem and that criminal investigations are not an effective remedy in this respect (see Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, § 217).396.
In such circumstances, and noting the absence over the years of tangible progress in any of the criminal investigations into the abductions of the applicants’ relatives, the Court concludes that this objection must be dismissed, since the remedy relied on by the Government was not effective in the circumstances.III.
THE COURT’S ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FACTSA.
The parties’ submissions1.
The Government397.
The Government did not contest the essential facts of each case as presented by the applicants. At the same time, they claimed that none of the investigations had obtained information proving that the applicants’ relatives had been apprehended and detained by State agents. According to them, there was no evidence proving beyond reasonable doubt that State agents had been involved in the abductions and deaths. Referring, in particular, to Debizova (no. 24708/09) and Ibragimova (no. 30592/10), the Government stated that the mere fact that the abductors had been armed and/or had driven a certain type of vehicle or had worn a particular type of uniform was not enough to presume the contrary. They pointed out that between 1996 and 2003 mercenaries of Slavic origin, including those from Ukraine, and other criminals had impersonated military servicemen and police officers to commit crimes. At the same time, the Government submitted, referring to the same two applications, that “the applicants furnished the proof that their relatives could have been detained by State representatives”. Lastly, in respect of all the cases the Government submitted that the bodies of the abducted men had never been found and there was no proof that they were dead.2.
The applicants398.
The applicants asserted that it had been established “beyond reasonable doubt” that the men who had taken away their relatives had been State agents. In support of that assertion they referred to the ample evidence contained in their submissions and the criminal investigation files, in so far as they had been disclosed by the Government. They also submitted that they had each made a prima facie case that their relatives had been abducted by State agents and that the essential facts underlying their complaints had not been challenged by the Government. In view of the absence of any news of their relatives for a long time and the life-threatening nature of unacknowledged detention in Chechnya at the relevant time, they asked the Court to consider their relatives dead.B.
General principles399.
The Court will examine each of the applications in the light of the general principles applicable in cases where the factual circumstances are in dispute between the parties (see El Masri v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” [GC], no. 39630/09, §§ 151-53, ECHR 2012).400.
The Court has addressed a whole series of cases concerning allegations of disappearances in the Chechen Republic. Applying the above‑mentioned principles, it has concluded that it would be sufficient for the applicants to make a prima facie case of abduction by servicemen, thus falling within the control of the authorities, and it would then be for the Government to discharge their burden of proof either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred (see, among many examples, Kosumova and Others v. Russia, no. 27441/07, § 67, 7 June 2011, and Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, § 99). If the Government failed to rebut that presumption, this would entail a violation of Article 2 in its substantive part. Conversely, where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (see, for example, Tovsultanova v. Russia, no. 26974/06, §§ 77-81, 17 June 2010, and Movsayevy v. Russia, no. 20303/07, § 76, 14 June 2011).401.
The Court has also found in many cases concerning disappearances in Chechnya that a missing person could be presumed dead. Having regard to the numerous cases of disappearances in the region which have come before it, the Court has found that in the particular context of the conflict, when a person was detained by unidentified State agents without any subsequent acknowledgment of the detention, this could be regarded as life‑threatening (see, among many others, Bazorkina v. Russia, no. 69481/01, 27 July 2006; Imakayeva v. Russia, no. 7615/02, ECHR 2006‑XIII (extracts); Luluyev and Others v. Russia, no. 69480/01, ECHR 2006‑VIII (extracts); Baysayeva v. Russia, no. 74237/01, 5 April 2007; Akhmadova and Sadulayeva v. Russia, no. 40464/02, 10 May 2007; Alikhadzhiyeva v. Russia, no. 68007/01, 5 July 2007; and Dubayev and Bersnukayeva v. Russia, nos. 30613/05 and 30615/05, 11 February 2010).402.
The Court has made findings of presumptions of death in the absence of any reliable news about the disappeared persons for periods ranging from four years (see Askhabova v. Russia, no. 54765/09, § 137, 18 April 2013) to more than ten years.C.

Conclusions463.
The Court finds that in all the cases the applicants’ relatives were abducted by armed men in uniforms, displaying behaviour characteristic of security operations. Their behaviour and appearance, their ability to pass through roadblocks and to cordon off areas, along with their use of vehicles, lead the Court to conclude that in all probability, they were none other than State servicemen. The applicants’ allegations are supported by the witness statements collected by them and by the investigations. In their submissions to the authorities the applicants consistently maintained that their relatives had been abducted by State agents. The domestic investigations accepted as fact the version of events as presented by the applicants and took steps to check whether State servicemen had been involved in the abductions. As it appears from the documents submitted to the Court, the investigations regarded the possibility of abduction by servicemen as the only, or at least the main, plausible explanation of the events.464.
In summary, the facts of each case contain sufficient elements to enable the Court to make findings about the carrying out of security operations and thus about the State’s exclusive control over the detainees (see, among many others, Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, § 114). The Government’s arguments are limited to references to the unfinished criminal investigations, or are of a speculative nature and stand in contradiction to the evidence reviewed by the Court. In any case, they are insufficient to discharge them of the burden of proof which has been shifted to them in such cases.465.
The detention in life-threatening circumstances of Mulat Barshigov, Isa Eskiyev, Usman Eskiyev, Zayndi Ayubov, Khamzan Debizov, Akhmed Kasumov, Magomed Kasumov, Adam Eskirkhanov, Ismail Taisumov, Aslambek Adiyev, Albert Midayev, Magomed Elmurzayev, Buvaysar Magomadov, Said Adiyev, Aydrus Saraliyev, Artur Yesiyev, Bislan Chadakhanov, Apti Dombayev, Gilani Aliyev, Mikhail Borchashvili, Aslanbek Viskhadzhiyev, Yasin Viskhadzhiyev, Sultan Viskhadzhiyev, Yusup Biysultanov, Anzor Ismailov, Masud Khakimov, Syal-Mirza Murdalov, Ayndi Islamov, Umar Islamov, Aslan Yusupov, Musa Merluyev, Adam Abdulvakhidov, Suliman Yunusov, Mausyr Basnukayev, Vakha Alisultanov and Shamsudi Alisultanov and the long periods of absence of any news of them lead the Court to conclude that they may be presumed dead.IV.
ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 2 OF THE CONVENTION466.
The applicants complained, under Article 2 of the Convention, that their relatives had disappeared after having been detained by State agents and that the domestic authorities had failed to carry out an effective investigation into the matter. Article 2 reads as follows:“1.
Everyone’s right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.2.
Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:(a)
in defence of any person from unlawful violence;(b)
in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;(c)
in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.”A.
The parties’ submissions467.
The Government contended that the domestic investigations had obtained no evidence that the applicants’ relatives had been held under State control or that they were dead. They further noted that the mere fact that the investigative measures had not produced any specific results, or had given only limited ones, did not mean that there were any omissions on the part of the investigative authorities. They claimed that all necessary steps were being taken to comply with the obligation to conduct an effective investigation.468.
The applicants reiterated their complaints.B.
The Court’s assessment1.
Admissibility469.
The Court considers, in the light of the parties’ submissions, that the complaints raise serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which requires an examination of the merits. The complaint under Article 2 of the Convention must therefore be declared admissible.2.
Merits(a)
Alleged violation of the right to life of the applicants’ relatives470.
The Court has already found that in all of the applications under examination, the applicants’ relatives may be presumed dead, following their unacknowledged detention by State agents. In the absence of any justification put forward by the Government, the Court finds that their deaths can be attributed to the State and that there has been a violation of the substantive aspect of Article 2 of the Convention in respect of Mulat Barshigov, Isa Eskiyev, Usman Eskiyev, Zayndi Ayubov, Khamzan Debizov, Akhmed Kasumov, Magomed Kasumov, Adam Eskirkhanov, Ismail Taisumov, Aslambek Adiyev, Albert Midayev, Magomed Elmurzayev, Buvaysar Magomadov, Said Adiyev, Aydrus Saraliyev, Artur Yesiyev, Bislan Chadakhanov, Apti Dombayev, Gilani Aliyev, Mikhail Borchashvili, Aslanbek Viskhadzhiyev, Yasin Viskhadzhiyev, Sultan Viskhadzhiyev, Yusup Biysultanov, Anzor Ismailov, Masud Khakimov, Syal-Mirza Murdalov, Ayndi Islamov, Umar Islamov, Aslan Yusupov, Musa Merluyev, Adam Abdulvakhidov, Suliman Yunusov, Mausyr Basnukayev, Vakha Alisultanov and Shamsudi Alisultanov.(b)
Alleged inadequacy of the investigations into the abductions471.
The Court has already found that a criminal investigation does not constitute an effective remedy in respect of disappearances which have occurred, in particular, in Chechnya between 1999 and 2006, and that such a situation constitutes a systemic problem under the Convention (see Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, § 217). In the case at hand, as in many previous similar cases reviewed by the Court, the investigations have been pending for many years without bringing about any significant developments as to the identities of the perpetrators or the fate of the applicants’ missing relatives. While the obligation to investigate effectively is one of means and not of results, the Court notes that each set of criminal proceedings was plagued by a combination of the same defects as those enumerated in the Aslakhanova and Others judgment (cited above, §§ 123‑25). Each was subjected to several decisions to suspend the investigation, followed by periods of inactivity, which further diminished the prospects of solving the crimes. No meaningful steps were taken to identify and question the servicemen who could have witnessed, registered or participated in the operations.472.
In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the authorities failed to carry out effective criminal investigations into the circumstances of the disappearance and death of the applicants’ relatives. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in its procedural aspect.V.
ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 3, 5 AND 13 OF THE CONVENTION473.
The applicants complained of a violation of Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention on account of the mental suffering caused to them by the disappearance of their relatives and the unlawfulness of their relatives’ detention. They also argued that, contrary to Article 13 of the Convention, they had no available domestic remedies against the alleged violations, in particular those under Articles 2 and 3. These Articles read, in so far as relevant:Article 3“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”Article 5“1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:...(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;...2. Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him.3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.5. Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an enforceable right to compensation.”Article 13“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”A.
The parties’ submissions474.
The Government contested the applicants’ claims.475.
The applicants reiterated their complaints.B.
The Court’s assessment1.
Admissibility476.
The Court notes that these complaints are not manifestly ill‑founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible.2.
Merits477.
The Court has found on many occasions that a situation of enforced disappearance gives rise to a violation of Article 3 in respect of the close relatives of the victim. The essence of such a violation does not lie mainly in the fact of the “disappearance” of the family member, but rather concerns the authorities’ reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention (see Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, § 358, 18 June 2002, and Imakayeva, cited above, § 164). Where the news about the missing person’s death was preceded by a sufficiently long period when he or she had been deemed disappeared, there exists a distinct period during which the applicants sustained uncertainty, anguish and distress characteristic to the specific phenomenon of disappearances (see Luluyev and Others, cited above, § 115).478.
Equally, the Court has found on many occasions that unacknowledged detention is a complete negation of the guarantees contained in Article 5 and discloses a particularly grave violation of its provisions (see Çiçek v. Turkey, no. 25704/94, § 164, 27 February 2001, and Luluyev and Others, cited above, § 122).479.
The Court reiterates its findings regarding the State’s responsibility for the abductions and the failure to carry out a meaningful investigation into the fates of the disappeared persons. It finds that the applicants, who are close relatives of the disappeared, must be considered victims of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the distress and anguish which they suffered, and continue to suffer, as a result of their inability to ascertain the fate of their family members and of the manner in which their complaints have been dealt with.480.
Given that it has been established that the applicants’ relatives were detained by State agents, apparently without any legal grounds or acknowledgement of such detention, this constitutes a particularly grave violation of the right to liberty and security of persons enshrined in Article 5 of the Convention.481.
The Court reiterates its findings regarding the general ineffectiveness of the criminal investigations in cases such as those under examination. In the absence of the results of the criminal investigation, any other possible remedy becomes inaccessible in practice.482.
The Court thus finds that the applicants in these cases did not dispose of an effective domestic remedy for their grievances under Articles 2 and 3, in breach of Article 13 of the Convention.VI.
APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION483.
Article 41 of the Convention provides:“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”A.

The Government(a)
Damages535.

Costs and expenses536.
The Government submitted, in respect of each application, that the applicants’ claims for costs and expenses were unsubstantiated as it had not been shown that the expenses claimed had actually been incurred.C.
The Court’s assessment537.
The Court reiterates that there must be a clear causal connection between the damages claimed by the applicants and the violation of the Convention, and that this may, where appropriate, include compensation in respect of loss of earnings. The Court further finds that the loss of earnings applies to close relatives of the disappeared persons, including spouses, elderly parents and minor children (see, among other authorities, Imakayeva, cited above, § 213).538.
Wherever the Court finds a violation of the Convention, it may accept that the applicants have suffered non-pecuniary damage which cannot be compensated for solely by the findings of violations, and make a financial award.539.
As to costs and expenses, the Court has to establish first whether the costs and expenses indicated by the applicants’ representatives were actually incurred and, second, whether they were necessary (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, § 220, Series A no. 324, and Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, § 147, ECHR 2005‑IV).540.
Having regard to its above conclusions, the principles enumerated above and the parties’ submissions, the Court awards the amounts to the applicants as detailed in Appendix II, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicants on those amounts. The awards in respect of costs and expenses are to be paid into the representatives’ bank accounts, as identified by the applicants.D.
Default interest541.
The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY1.
Decides to join the applications; 2.
Declares the applications admissible; 3.

Risnes; to be converted into Russian roubles to the applicants represented by Mr D. Itslayev, Mr Z. Sobraliyev and the Committee Against Torture; and to be made in British pounds to the applicant represented by the EHRAC;(b)
