The case originated in twelve applications (see details in Appendix I) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Russian nationals (“the applicants”), on the dates indicated below in Appendix I.2.
The applicants were represented before the Court by Mr D. Itslayev, a lawyer practising in Russia, lawyers from the Stichting Russian Justice Initiative (SRJI) (in partnership with NGO Astreya), an NGO based in the Netherlands with a representative office in Russia, lawyers from the Memorial Human Rights Centre/the European Human Rights Advocacy Centre (EHRAC), an NGO based in Russia and the UK and lawyers from Materi Chechni, an NGO based in Russia. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.3.
The applicants alleged that on various dates between 2000 and 2005 their eighteen relatives had been abducted by State servicemen in Chechnya and Ingushetia and that no effective investigation into the matter had taken place.4.
On the dates indicated in Appendix I the applications were communicated to the Government.THE FACTSI.
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE5.
The applicants are Russian nationals who are close relatives of persons who disappeared after allegedly being arrested by servicemen. In each of the applications the events took place in areas under the full control of the Russian federal forces.6.
The applicants complained to law-enforcement bodies and official investigations were opened. The proceedings were repeatedly suspended and resumed, and have remained pending for several years without achieving any tangible results. The investigations consisted mainly of the authorities making requests for information and formal requests to their counterparts in various parts of Chechnya and Ingushetia and other regions of the North Caucasus to take operational search measures. The requests received negative responses or no replies at all.7.
From the documents submitted it appears that the relevant State authorities were unable to identify the State servicemen allegedly involved in the arrests or abductions.8.
In their observations the Government did not challenge the allegations as presented by the applicants. At the same time, they stated that there was no evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that State agents had been involved in the abductions.9.
Below are summaries of the facts relevant to each individual application. They are based on the statements provided by the applicants, their relatives and neighbours and copies of the contents of the criminal investigation files furnished by the Government. The personal data of the applicants and their disappeared relatives, and some other key facts, are summarized below and in the attached table (Appendix I).A.
Application no. 42575/07, Sultygov and Others v. Russia10.
The applicants are:(1)
Mr Gerikhan Sultygov, born in 1972;(2)
Ms Fatima Sultygova, born in 1966;(3)
Mr Musadi Samrailov, born in 1943, and(4)
Ms Maus Nasayeva, born in 1953.The first applicant resides in Chippis, Switzerland. The second applicant lives in Boras, Sweden. The fourth applicant resides in Grozny, Chechnya; prior to his death, the third applicant also lived there.11.
The third applicant, Mr Musadi Samrailov, passed away on 3 February 2013. Mr Viskhan Samrailov, his grandson and the son of Mr Visadi Samrailov, expressed his wish to pursue the application.12.
The first and second applicants are the siblings of Mr Alikhan Sultygov, who was born in 1969. The third and fourth applicants are the father and stepmother of Mr Visadi Samrailov, who was born in 1964.1.
Abduction of the applicants’ relatives and subsequent events13.
In 2000 the Sultygov family, including the first and second applicants and their children, moved from Grozny to Ingushetia owing to armed hostilities. In the summer of 2000 Mr Alikhan Sultygov returned to Grozny to check on the family house left behind.14.
On the morning of 4 August 2000 Mr D.U. and Mr Alikhan Sultygov drove in the latter’s Volga car to the house of the Samrailov family through checkpoint no. 7 on the outskirts of Grozny. The checkpoint was manned by servicemen of Special Police Forces Unit (OMON) from the Sverdlovsk Region. The servicemen checked Mr Alikhan Sultygov’s and Mr D.U.’s identity documents and let them through.15.
On the way back, after having picked up Mr Visadi Samrailov, the three men were stopped at the checkpoint and detained. Mr Alikhan Sultygov, Mr Visadi Samrailov and Mr D.U. were placed in a UAZ vehicle and taken to the Leninskiy district military commander’s office which was situated in the same building as the Leninskiy district department of the interior (the ROVD). Mr Alikhan Sultygov’s car was driven by one of the servicemen. At the office the three men were blindfolded, their hands were bound and they were put in an APC which took them to the main base of the federal military forces in Khankala.16.
Upon their arrival at the base the three men were put into a pit measuring about two or three metres in depth and about one and a half metres in diameter. The bottom of the pit was covered with stones and broken glass. The three men were not allowed to remove the blindfolds and their hands remained bound; they were not fed, and only given water. The soldiers threw stones at them.17.
On the next day several servicemen took Mr Alikhan Sultygov out of the pit. He never returned. Two days later the servicemen took away Mr Visadi Samrailov. Later on the same date Mr D.U. was also taken out of the pit, driven for about thirty minutes and released on a highway. The abductors told him to keep his blindfold on for thirty minutes and threatened to kill him if he shared any information about the detention. Then Mr D.U. walked to Grozny.18.
The applicants have not seen their relatives Mr Alikhan Sultygov and Mr Visadi Samrailov since 4 August 2000.2.

At about 2 a.m. on 4 May 2003 a group of armed men in camouflage uniforms and masks who spoke unaccented Russian broke into the house. The applicant and his relatives thought that the intruders were federal servicemen. Holding the applicant at gunpoint, the servicemen grabbed Mr Anzor Idigov, who was undressed and barefoot, bound his hands, sealed his mouth with adhesive tape and took him away to an unknown destination. Immediately after that two perpetrators returned and ordered the applicant to hand over Mr Anzor Indigov’s identity documents, saying that they were in a pocket of his jacket.107.

Abduction of the applicants’ relative and subsequent events124.
At the material time the applicants resided at 14/1 Stantsionnaya Street in Grozny. Their property consisted of two houses with a shared courtyard.125.
On the night between 2 and 3 March 2006 the second applicant and her son Mr Idris Saayev were in one house, whilst the second applicant’s husband, Mr Kh.S., was in the other one.126.
At about 5 a.m. on 3 March 2006 the second applicant woke up and saw a group of six armed men in camouflage uniforms. All of them but one, who was in charge of the group, were masked and wearing bulletproof jackets and spherical helmets. They were armed with submachine guns with silencers and pistols secured at the thighs by special rifle belts. The applicants thought they were federal servicemen.127.
Without any explanation the servicemen requested in unaccented Russian that Mr Idris Saayev produce his identity papers and mobile telephone. They also asked the second applicant about her other son, Mr A.S. Shortly thereafter they took Mr Idris Saayev outside without letting him put on any clothing. When the second applicant and her husband got outside, she saw the perpetrators’ UAZ minivan driving away.128.
At about 6 a.m. on 3 March 2006 the second applicant, her husband Mr Kh.S. and a relative went to the Staropromyslovskiy department of the interior in Grozny (“the ROVD”) to complain about the abduction of Mr Idris Saayev. A police officer told them that Mr Idris Saayev had been detained by the security forces and that he would return home if he cooperated with them and if the applicants did not lodge any official complaints. The second applicant then decided not to lodge a formal complaint, as suggested by the police officer.129.
In the days that followed the applicants applied in person to various State authorities seeking assistance in the search for their relative; none of the law-enforcement agencies admitted arresting or detaining Mr Idris Saayev.130.
About a week later the police officer from the ROVD told the applicants that Mr Idris Saayev had been transferred to Operational Search Bureau no. 2 (“ORB-2”) in Grozny.

On an unspecified date a certain Mr R.K. told the applicants that Mr Idris Saayev had been abducted by officers of the Federal Security Service (“the FSB”). Subsequently, the applicants provided Mr R.K.’s phone number to the investigators (see paragraph 138 below).132.
The applicants have not seen Mr Idris Saayev since 3 March 2006.2.
Official investigation into the abduction(a)
Main witness statements taken by the investigators133.
On 5 April 2006 the investigators questioned the second applicant, whose statement was similar to the one submitted by the applicants to the Court. She pointed out that the perpetrators had been Russian servicemen and that she had tried to find her son without recourse to an official investigation but to no avail. She stated that the abductors had called her neighbours’ phone, asked to speak to her, and told her that they would discuss the details of her son’s release with her. When at the end of March 2006 she had arrived at the place of the meeting suggested by them, she had seen a vehicle with servicemen in it who had filmed her and left without demanding anything. Having realised that her efforts to find her son were unproductive, about four weeks after the abduction she decided to lodge an official complaint about it.134.
On the same date, 5 April 2006, the investigators questioned the applicants’ neighbours Ms Z.I., Mr R.Zh., Mr A.M., Ms A.D. and Mr R.A., all of whom stated that they had not witnessed the abduction but had learnt about it from the applicants.135.

Abduction of the applicant’s son152.
In 2002 the applicant and Mr Rustam Amerkhanov, who suffered from a brain tumour, resided in the village of Shalazhi (also spelt Shalazi), in the Urus-Martan district. At the material time the settlement was under the full control of the federal forces; a number of military units and law‑enforcement agencies were stationed therein.153.
At about 8 p.m. on 3 November 2002 Mr Rustam Amerkhanov left to visit Mr A., a friend who lived nearby, and did not return.154.
On the morning of 4 November 2002 the applicant found out that her son had not visited his friend’s house and that on the night between 3 and 4 November 2002 he had been detained by servicemen from the 47th unit of the Special Task Force Division (DON-2) of the Internal Troops of the Russian Ministry of the Interior.155.
On 5 November 2002 the applicant lodged an abduction complaint with the Urus-Martan district prosecutor’s office. On the same date the interim district prosecutor, Mr D.Z., obtained confirmation from the Urus‑Martan district department of the interior (ROVD) that Mr Rustam Amerkhanov had been brought by servicemen to the ROVD at about 8 a.m. on 4 November 2002 for an identity check and released about three hours later.156.
On the same date the applicant, with two of her relatives and the interim district prosecutor, spoke to the officer in charge of the military unit who had detained the applicant’s son. At first the officer stated that Mr Rustam Amerkhanov had been released shortly after the arrest, but then admitted that he had been taken to the ROVD.157.
On the morning of 6 November 2002 (in the documents submitted the date is also referred to as 4 and 9 November 2002) the interim district prosecutor Mr D.Z. confirmed to the applicant that her son was detained on the premises of the ROVD and that he would be released shortly.

A week later Mr D.Z., who had been on a service mission in Chechnya, left the Republic to return to the place of his permanent employment. Prior to his departure he told the applicant that the deputy head of the ROVD, Mr V.B., had questioned Mr Rustam Amerkhanov after the arrest.159.
On an unspecified date the applicant contacted Mr V.B. and he confirmed to her that he had interviewed her son, that it had been established that the latter had not participated in illegal armed groups and that therefore her son had been released.160.
The applicant has not seen Mr Rustam Amerkhanov since 3 November 2002.161.
In their submission on the facts the Government submitted that Mr Rustam Amerkhanov had been detained by the 47th military unit on the night between 3 and 4 November 2002 and at 7 or 8 a.m. on 4 November 2002 he had been taken to the Special Task Unit (OMON), which was staffed by servicemen from the Omsk region of Russia and was stationed on the premises of the former fruit canning factory. Mr Rustam Amerkhanov was handed over to the head of the OMON unit, officer V.G.162.
At about 9.15 a.m. on 4 November 2002 Mr Rustam Amerkhanov was taken to see the deputy head of the Urus-Martan ROVD, officer V.B., who signed a statement to that effect. At the ROVD the identity of the applicant’s son was verified and he was interviewed. Shortly thereafter, as his involvement in illegal armed groups had not been confirmed, on the same date, 4 November 2002, Mr Rustam Amerkhanov was released. His whereabouts have been unknown since.2.

Main witness statements taken by the investigators163.
On 6 November 2002 the investigators questioned officer V. G., who confirmed that his unit had detained Mr Rustam Amerkhanov at about 2 a.m. on 4 November 2002.

At about 8 a.m. on 4 November 2002 he received an order from the deputy head of the Urus‑Martan ROVD to hand Mr Rustam Amerkhanov over to the police. At about 9.15 on the same morning the witness brought Mr Rustam Amerkhanov to the deputy head of the ROVD, officer V.B. The witness explained that he had initially told the applicant that her son had not been arrested by his unit as he had been concerned that “it would lead to disturbances among the local residents”.164.
On 6 November 2002 the investigators questioned the applicant, whose statement was similar to the one submitted to the Court.165.
On 11 November 2002 the investigators questioned the deputy head of the ROVD, officer V.B., who stated that between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. on 4 November 2002 he had interviewed Mr Rustam Amerkhanov and then released him.

On 15 November 2002 the investigators questioned the applicant, who reiterated her previous statement. In addition, she stated that the deputy head of the ROVD officer V.B. had “blatantly lied” to the investigators that he had released her son on 4 November 2002 as she and two of her relatives, Ms T.A. and Ms Kh.A., and a friend had spent the entire day at the entrance to the building to no avail.168.

B. had deliberately lied to him and the applicant, denying Mr Rustam Amerkhanov’s arrest, and that this officer must have been responsible for the disappearance of the applicant’s son.170.
On 29 April 2004 the investigators again questioned the applicant’s sister Ms T.A., who reiterated her previous statement. In addition, she stated that a few days after the disappearance of Mr Rustam Amerkhanov officer V.B. had told her husband, Mr N.A., that Mr Rustam Amerkhanov had been transferred to another law-enforcement agency.171.

The intruders arrived in several vehicles which they parked nearby; some of them carried portable radios. All the intruders spoke unaccented Russian. The applicants inferred that they were federal servicemen. Having searched the house without giving explanations, the servicemen ordered Ms Milana Ozdoyeva to leave with them. One of the servicemen told the first applicant that her daughter would return later in the morning.193.
The first applicant and Mr A.M. followed the servicemen outside and tried to follow the abductors but they had to return to the house due to the curfew.194.

At the material time the applicants resided in a family house together with Mr Ezir-Ali Shakhbiyev, Mr Abzu Shakhbiyev and Mr Said‑Magomed Shakhbiyev. Mr N. Ochayev was also staying in their house as he had been hired by the first and second applicants to work in his excavator on their property.218.
Early in the morning on 4 September 2000 Russian servicemen launched a “sweeping-up” operation in the settlement of Tsotsi-Yurt. The settlement was surrounded by servicemen riding in URAL lorries and military UAZ cars. Helicopters were flying over the area.219.
At around 5 a.m. on 4 September 2000 an APC and several UAZ cars and URAL lorries arrived at the applicants’ house. A group of twenty‑five to thirty masked servicemen in camouflage uniforms broke in. They blindfolded Mr Ezir-Ali Shakhbiyev, Mr Abzu Shakhbiyev, Mr Said‑Magomed Shakhbiyev and Mr N. Ochayev with torn sheets and took them outside. The servicemen put Mr Ezir-Ali Shakhbiyev in his own VAZ‑2106 car and the other three men in a URAL lorry and drove away.220.

The documents submitted by the Government show that at some point between 2000 and 2004 the investigation of the criminal case was extended to include the abduction of Mr Apti Medzhidov and Mr Akhmed Dudurkayev. The investigation files were referred to under numbers 12239, 12355 and 10075.350.
On 15 August 2004 the investigators granted the eighth applicant victim status in the criminal case.351.
On 16 August 2004 the investigators granted the fourth applicant victim status in the criminal case.352.
Between 2001 and 2005 the investigation into the abductions was suspended on several occasions. For instance, the investigation was suspended on 28 May 2005, resumed on 15 June 2005 and suspended again on 15 July 2005.353.
On 6 May 2006 the investigators stated in a procedural decision that it was established that the applicants’ four relatives had been “abducted by unidentified servicemen belonging to power structures and then taken to [the main military base in] Khankala”. The investigators stated that Ms Satsyta Sadykova and Ms Markha Tatsuyeva had been arrested together with the four men, detained in Khankala and then transferred to the premises of the Rostov-on-Don FSB and that on 21 July 2000 both women had been released.354.
On 31 May 2007 the investigation was resumed.355.
On 15 July 2007 the investigators examined the crime scene. No evidence was collected.356.
On 16 July 2007 the investigation into the abduction of the applicants’ four relatives was joined to the investigation into the abduction of Ms Satsyta Sadykova. The joint investigation file was given the number 12239.357.
On 16 July 2007 the investigation was suspended. It was resumed on 25 July 2007.358.
On 25 August 2007 the investigation was suspended and then resumed on the following day, 26 August 2007.359.
On 26 September 2007 the investigation was suspended and then resumed on 13 October 2007.360.
On 15 November 2007 the investigation was suspended again. The applicants were informed thereof.361.
On an unspecified date in July 2009 the first applicant wrote to a local human rights organisation asking for assistance in the search for her son Mr Apti Medzhidov. On 11 August 2009 that request was forwarded to the investigators.362.
On an unspecified date in June 2011 the eighth applicant wrote to a local human rights organisation asking for assistance in the search for her husband, Mr Alu Bultayev. On 27 June 20011 the request was forwarded to the investigators.363.
On 20 December 2011 the investigation was resumed. It is still pending.II.
RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE AND INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS364.
For a summary of the relevant domestic law and practice and for international and domestic reports on disappearances in Chechnya and Ingushetia, see Aslakhanova and Others v. Russia, (nos. 2944/06, 8300/07, 50184/07, 332/08 and 42509/10, §§ 43-59 and §§ 69-84, 18 December 2012).THE LAWI.
JOINDER OF THE APPLICATIONS365.
In accordance with Rule 42 § 1 of the Rules of Court, the Court decides to join the applications, given their similar factual and legal background.II.
THE APPLICANTS’ COMPLIANCE WITH THE SIX-MONTH RULEA.
The parties’ submissions1.
Government366.
The Government did not comment on the applicants’ compliance with the six‑month rule.2.
The applicants367.
The applicants argued that they had complied with the six-month rule and there had been no excessive and unexplained delays in the submission of their applications to the Court. In particular, they submitted that after the initiation of the criminal investigations they had had no reason to doubt their effectiveness. They pointed out that the armed conflict in the region had led them to believe that delays in the investigation were inevitable. Moreover, owing to their poor command of Russian, their lack of legal knowledge and lack of funds to hire a lawyer, and in the absence of domestic provisions enabling victims of enforced disappearances to obtain free legal assistance, they had been unable to assess the effectiveness of the investigation. As soon as the applicants had been able to obtain legal advice, they had realised that the investigations were ineffective owing to the delays in their completion and they had applied to the Court.368.
Referring to Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, the applicants argued that the six-month rule did not apply to “continuing situations” such as cases of enforced disappearances.B.
The Court’s assessment1.
General principles369.
The Court reiterates that the purpose of the six-month rule is to promote legal certainty, to ensure that cases are dealt with within a reasonable time and to protect the parties from uncertainty for a prolonged period of time. The rule also provides the opportunity to ascertain the facts of the case before memory of them fades away with time (see Abuyeva and Others v. Russia, cited above, § 175).370.
Normally, the six-month period runs from the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. In the absence of any such decision, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of. Where an applicant avails himself of an existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, the six-month time‑limit is calculated from the date when the applicant first became, or ought to have become, aware of those circumstances (see, among others, Zenin v. Russia (dec.), no. 15413/03, 24 September 2009).371.
In cases concerning disappearances, unlike in cases concerning ongoing investigations into the deaths of applicants’ relatives (see, for example, Elsanova v. Russia (dec.), no. 57952/00, 15 November 2005, and Narin v. Turkey, no. 18907/02, § 50, 15 December 2009), the Court has held that taking into account the uncertainty and confusion typical of such situations, the nature of the ensuing investigations implies that the relatives of a disappeared person may be justified in waiting lengthy periods of time for the national authorities to conclude their proceedings, even if those proceedings are sporadic and plagued by problems. As long as there is some meaningful contact between families and the authorities concerning complaints and requests for information, or some indication, or realistic possibility, of progress in investigative measures, considerations of undue delay will not generally arise. However, where there has been a considerable lapse of time, and there have been significant delays and lulls in investigative activity, there will come a time when the relatives must realise that no effective investigation has been, or will be, provided. When this stage is reached will depend, unavoidably, on the circumstances of the particular case. Where more than ten years have elapsed since the incident, the applicants have to justify such a delay in lodging their application with the Court (see Varnava, cited above, §§ 162‑63).372.
Applying the Varnava principles, the Court recently found in the case of Er and Others v. Turkey (no. 23016/04, §§ 55-58, 31 July 2012) that the applicants, who had waited for a period of almost ten years after the disappearance of their relative before lodging their application, had complied with the six-month rule because an investigation was being conducted at the national level. The Court reached a similar conclusion in another case, where the domestic investigation into the events had been pending for more than eight years and where the applicants were doing all that could be expected of them to assist the authorities (see Bozkır and Others v. Turkey, no. 24589/04, § 49, 26 February 2013).373.
In the cases concerning enforced disappearances in Chechnya and Ingushetia, the Court has examined applications lodged between nine and ten years after the disappearances and the initiation of the criminal investigation (see, for example, Kaykharova and Others v. Russia, nos. 11554/07, 7862/08, 56745/08 and 61274/09, §§ 128 and 129, 1 August 2013; Saidova v. Russia, no. 51432/09, §§ 52 and 53, 1 August 2013; and Gakayeva and Others v. Russia, cited above, §§ 312 and 315,), where certain lulls in the ongoing investigations comprised up to four and a half years. The Court found that the applicants had justified the delays in lodging their applications with the Court by demonstrating that they had maintained reasonable contact with the authorities, sought information on the progress of the investigation and lodged their applications shortly after having obtained information casting reasonable doubt on the effectiveness of the ongoing proceedings.374.
By contrast, the Court has declared inadmissible applications where the applicants waited for more than ten years to lodge their applications with the Court, and where there had been, for a long time, no evidence allowing them to believe that the investigation would be effective. For instance, in the case of Yetişen and Others v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 21099/06, 10 July 2012), the applicants waited for four years after the disappearance before lodging an official complaint with the competent investigating authorities and for eleven-and-a-half years before bringing their application to Strasbourg; in the case of Findik and Omer v. Turkey ((decs.), nos. 33898/11 and 35798/11, 9 October 2012), the applications were brought to Strasbourg more than fifteen years after the events; and in the case of Taşçi and Duman v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 40787/10, 9 October 2012), the applicants applied to Strasbourg twenty-three years after the disappearance. In those cases, as in the case of Açış v. Turkey (no. 7050/05, §§ 41-42, 1 February 2011), where the applicants complained to Strasbourg more than twelve years after the disappearance, the Court rejected their complaints under Article 2 of the Convention as out of time for failure to demonstrate any concrete advance in the domestic investigation that would justify their delay of more than ten years.2.
Application of the principles to the present case375.
Turning to the circumstances of the cases at hand, the Court notes that in nine cases the applicants lodged their complaints with the Court within a period ranging from less than two years after the disappearance in the application of Saayeva and Others (no. 3375/08) to almost eight years in the application of Dubayevy (no. 3222/11). In each of these cases the investigations were formally pending at the time when the applications were lodged with the Court. The criminal proceedings in all the cases were suspended and resumed on several occasions at various time intervals throughout the periods concerned. Each and every time the investigations were suspended and then resumed following criticism of the investigation by supervisors, and the applicants were not always informed thereof. They, in turn, maintained a reasonable level of contact with the authorities, cooperated with the investigation and, where appropriate, took steps to inform themselves of the progress of the proceedings and to speed them up, in the hope of a more effective outcome.376.
As for the three applications lodged within a period of between nine and almost eleven years after the alleged abductions, the Court notes the following. In the application Shakhbiyeva and Others (no. 62220/10), lodged ten years after the abduction and the initiation of the investigation, the applicants took an active role from the beginning and convinced the authorities to investigate their allegations in spite of their initial refusal to do so (see paragraphs 231 and 232 above). For the next several years the applicants cooperated with the investigators by giving statements and providing necessary information. Then, between May 2005 and January 2010, that is, for almost four years and eight months, the investigation was dormant and was resumed only upon the applicants’ request (see paragraph 237 above). From the documents submitted it can be ascertained that the applicants, who were not informed of the suspension, did not officially contact the investigation themselves during this period. Such a lengthy period of inactivity could be considered significant enough to raise doubts as to whether the investigation was still effective. However, taking into account the fact that the applicants were not duly informed of the suspension and that the proceedings were resumed as a result of their request and the first applicant having gained access to the investigation file (see paragraphs 237 and 241 above) which allowed them to assess the progress of the criminal proceedings and led to their prompt application to Strasbourg, the Court, bearing in mind the specific context of disappearance cases, accepts the applicants’ explanation for the delay in bringing their application to Strasbourg.377.
Turning to the application Cholayevy (no. 24744/11) lodged with the Court nine years and five months after the abduction and the start of the investigation, the Court observes that throughout the entire period there were no significant lulls in the investigation and that the applicants maintained regular contact with the authorities.378.
As for the application Titiyeva and Others (no. 36897/11) lodged ten years and eleven months after of the abduction, the Court observes that in spite of the lengthy period of the ongoing criminal investigation, no significant lulls in the proceedings occurred and that the applicants remained in contact with the authorities throughout.379.
Having examined the documents submitted by the parties, the Court finds that the conduct of the applicants in each application vis-à-vis the investigation has been determined not by their perception of the remedy as ineffective, but rather by their expectation that the authorities would, of their own motion, provide them with an adequate answer to their serious complaints. They furnished the investigating authorities with timely and sufficiently detailed accounts of their relatives’ abductions and cooperated with them. They thus reasonably expected further substantive developments from the investigation. It could not be said that they failed to show the requisite diligence by waiting for the pending investigation to yield results (see, mutatis mutandis, Abuyeva and Others, cited above, § 179).380.
The Court thus considers that an investigation, albeit a sporadic one, was being conducted during the periods in question in each of the cases, and that the applicants did all that could be expected of them to assist the authorities (see Varnava and Others, cited above, § 166, and Er and Others, cited above, § 60). In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the applicants complied with the six-month time-limit.III.
THE GOVERNMENT’S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONSA.
Locus standi1.
The parties’ submissions381.
Mr Musadi Samrailov, the third applicant in application Sultygov and Others (no. 42575/07), died on 3 February 2013. Mr Viskhan Samrailov, his grandson and the son of the disappeared Mr Visadi Samrailov, expressed his wish to pursue the proceedings before the Court in his stead.382.
Mr Tukhan Idigov, the applicant in Idigov ( no.424/08), died on 5 January 2013. Ms Tamara Idigova, his daughter and the sister of the disappeared Mr Anzor Idigov, expressed her wish to pursue the proceedings before the Court in his stead.383.
The Government contended in respect of both applications that neither Mr Viskhan Samrailov nor Ms Tamara Idigova had standing in the proceedings before the Court owing to their “lack of a legitimate interest in the examination of the case”.2.
The Court’s assessment384.
The Court reiterates that the word “victim” in the context of Article 34 of the Convention denotes the person directly affected by the act or omission in issue (see Lüdi v Switzerland, 15 June 1992, § 34, Series A no. 238). The Convention institutions have always and unconditionally considered in their case-law that the parent, sibling or nephew of a person whose death is alleged to engage the responsibility of the respondent Government can claim to be the victim of an alleged violation of Article 2 of the Convention, even where closer relatives, such as the deceased person’s children, have not submitted applications (see Velikova v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 41488/98, 18 May 1999, with further references).385.
The Court also notes that in a number of cases in which an applicant died in the course of the proceedings it has taken into account the statements of the applicant’s heirs or of close family members expressing a wish to pursue the proceedings before the Court. It has done so most frequently in cases which primarily involved pecuniary, and, for this reason, transferable claims. However, the question of whether such claims are transferable to the individuals seeking to pursue an application is not the exclusive criterion. In fact, human rights cases before the Court generally also have a moral dimension, and people close to an applicant may have a legitimate interest in ensuring that justice is done, even after the applicant’s death (see, among other authorities, Horváthová v. Slovakia, no. 74456/01, § 26, 17 May 2005, and Ječius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, § 41, ECHR 2000-IX).386.
Having regard to the above, the Court accepts that the applicants’ close relatives have a legitimate interest in pursuing the application in their stead. It will therefore continue dealing with the case at their request.B. Exhaustion of domestic remedies1.
The parties’ submissions387.
The Government submitted that the criminal investigations into the disappearances were still in progress. It was therefore premature to draw any conclusions concerning the alleged ineffectiveness of the domestic criminal proceedings. They also pointed out that the applicants could have claimed civil damages and appealed against the investigators’ decisions in the national courts.388.
The applicants submitted that they were not obliged to pursue civil remedies and that lodging complaints against the investigators would not have remedied the investigations’ shortcomings. They all submitted that the only effective remedy in their cases – a criminal investigation into the abduction – had proved to be ineffective.2.
The Court’s assessment389.
As regards a civil action to obtain redress for damage sustained as a result of the alleged illegal acts or unlawful conduct of State agents, the Court has already found in a number of similar cases that this procedure alone cannot be regarded as an effective remedy in the context of claims brought under Article 2 of the Convention (see Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, nos. 57942/00 and 57945/00, §§ 119-21, 24 February 2005, and Estamirov and Others v. Russia, no. 60272/00, § 77). Accordingly, the Court confirms that the applicants were not obliged to pursue civil remedies. The preliminary objection in this regard is thus dismissed.390.
As regards criminal-law remedies, in a recent judgment the Court concluded that the ineffective investigation of disappearances that occurred in Chechnya and Ingushetia between 2000 and 2006 constituted a systemic problem and that criminal investigations were not an effective remedy in this respect (see Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, § 217).IV.
THE COURT’S ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FACTSA.
The parties’ submissions1.
The Government391.
The Government did not contest the essential facts underlying each application. However, they noted that some of the applicants had not been consistent in their descriptions of the abductors and that the abductions had taken place on various dates and in different districts. The Government pointed out that the abductions could have been perpetrated by members of illegal armed groups in the guise of State servicemen, using uniforms and documents similar to those used by the latter. They further claimed that none of the investigations had obtained evidence proving beyond reasonable doubt that State agents had been involved in the abductions and alleged deaths of the applicants’ relatives.2.
The applicants392.
The applicants submitted that it had been established “beyond reasonable doubt” that the men who had taken their relatives away had been State agents. In support of that assertion they referred to the ample evidence contained in their submissions and the criminal investigation files. They also submitted that they had each made a prima facie case that their relatives had been abducted by State agents and that the essential facts underlying their complaints had not been challenged by the Government. In view of the absence of any news of their relatives for a long time and the life-threatening nature of unacknowledged detention in the region at the relevant time, they asked the Court to consider their relatives dead.B.
The Court’s assessment1.
General principles393.
The Court shall examine the applications at hand in the light of the general principles applicable in cases where the factual circumstances are in dispute between the parties (see El Masri v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” [GC], no. 39630/09, §§ 151-53, ECHR‑2012).394.
The Court has addressed a whole series of cases concerning allegations of disappearances in Chechnya and Ingushetia. Applying the above‑mentioned principles, it has concluded that if applicants make a prima facie case of abduction by servicemen, this is sufficient for them to show that their relatives fell within the control of the authorities, and it is then for the Government to discharge their burden of proof either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred (see, among many examples, Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, § 99). If the Government fail to rebut that presumption, this will entail a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in its substantive part. Conversely, where applicants fail to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof cannot be reversed (see, for example, Tovsultanova v. Russia, no. 26974/06, §§ 77-81, 17 June 2010; Movsayevy v. Russia, no. 20303/07, § 76, 14 June 2011; and Shafiyeva v. Russia, no. 49379/09, § 71, 3 May 2012).395.
The Court has also found in many cases concerning disappearances that a missing person may be presumed dead. Having regard to the numerous cases of disappearances in Chechnya and Ingushetia which have come before it, the Court has found that in the particular context of the conflict in the region, when a person has been detained by unidentified State agents without any subsequent acknowledgment of the detention, this could be regarded as life‑threatening (see, among many others, Yandiyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 34541/06, 43811/06 and 1578/07, 10 October 2013, and Dovletukayev and Others v. Russia, cited above).396.
The Court has made findings of presumptions of deaths in the absence of any reliable news about the disappeared persons for periods ranging from four years (see Askhabova v. Russia, no. 54765/09, § 137, 18 April 2013) to more than ten years.2.

A number of witness statements collected by the applicants, along with the documents from the investigation file furnished by the Government (see, for example, paragraphs 19-26 above), demonstrate that the applicants’ relatives, Mr Alikhan Sultygov and Mr Visadi Samrailov, were abducted on 4 August 2000 by a group of armed servicemen at the checkpoint on the outskirts of Grozny. In view of all the materials in its possession, the Court finds that the applicants have presented a prima facie case that their relatives were abducted by State agents in the circumstances as set out by them.398.
The Government did not provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation for the events in question. Therefore, they failed to discharge their burden of proof.399.
Bearing in mind the general principles enumerated above, the Court finds that Mr Alikhan Sultygov and Mr Visadi Samrailov were taken into custody by State agents on 4 August 2000 in Grozny.

Several witness statements collected by the applicants, along with the documents from the investigation file furnished by the Government (see, for example, paragraphs 249-51 above), demonstrate that the applicants’ relative, Mr Sharpudi Dubayev, was abducted on 20 November 2002 by a group of armed military servicemen on the outskirts of Berkat-Yurt. In view of all the materials in its possession, the Court finds that the applicants have presented a prima facie case that their relative was abducted by State agents in the circumstances as set out by them.422.
The Government did not provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation for the events in question. Therefore, they failed to discharge their burden of proof.423.
Bearing in mind the general principles enumerated above, the Court finds that Mr Sharpudi Dubayev was taken into custody by State agents on 20 November 2002 in Berkat-Yurt. In view of the absence of any news of him since that date and the life-threatening nature of such detention (see paragraph 395 above), the Court also finds that Mr Sharpudi Dubayev may be presumed dead following his unacknowledged detention.(j)
Application no. 22257/11, Tekhiyeva v. Russia424.
A number of witness statements collected by the applicant, along with the documents from the investigation file furnished by the Government (see, for example, paragraphs 268-71 above), demonstrate that the applicant’s son, Mr Magomed-Salakh Tekhiyev, was abducted on 4 May 2004 by a group of armed servicemen in Serzhen-Yurt. In view of all the materials in its possession, the Court finds that the applicant has presented a prima facie case that her son was abducted by State agents in the circumstances as set out by her.425.
The Government did not provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation for the events in question. Therefore, they failed to discharge their burden of proof.426.
Bearing in mind the general principles enumerated above, the Court finds that Mr Magomed-Salakh Tekhiyev was taken into custody by State agents on 4 May 2004 in Serzhen-Yurt. In view of the absence of any news of him since that date and the life-threatening nature of the detention (see paragraph 395 above), the Court also finds that Mr Magomed-Salakh Tekhiyev may be presumed dead following his unacknowledged detention.(k)
Application no. 24744/11, Cholayevy v. Russia427.
Several witness statements collected by the applicants, along with the documents from the investigation file furnished by the Government (see, for example, paragraphs 294-97 above), demonstrate that the applicants’ relative, Mr Timerlan Cholayev, was abducted on 12 October 2001 by a group of armed military servicemen in Argun. In view of all the materials in its possession, the Court finds that the applicants have presented a prima facie case that their relative was abducted by State agents in the circumstances as set out by them.428.
The Government did not provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation for the events in question. Therefore, they failed to discharge their burden of proof.429.
Bearing in mind the general principles enumerated above, the Court finds that Mr Timerlan Cholayev was taken into custody by State agents on 12 October 2001 in Argun. In view of the absence of any news of him since that date and the life-threatening nature of the detention (see paragraph 395 above), the Court also finds that Mr Timerlan Cholayev may be presumed dead following his unacknowledged detention.(l)
Application no. 36897/11, Titiyeva and Others v. Russia430.
Several witness statements collected by the applicants, along with the documents from the investigation file furnished by the Government (see, for example, paragraphs 334-39 and 342 above), demonstrate that the applicants’ four relatives, Mr Apti Medzhidov, Mr Akhmed Dudurkayev, Mr Visarkhan Dokuyev and Mr Alu Bultayev, were abducted on 16 July 2000 by a group of armed servicemen during a special operation in Grozny. In view of all the materials in its possession, the Court finds that the applicants have presented a prima facie case that their relatives were abducted by State agents in the circumstances as set out by them.431.
The Government did not provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation for the events in question. Therefore, they failed to discharge their burden of proof.432.
Bearing in mind the general principles enumerated above, the Court finds that Mr Apti Medzhidov, Mr Akhmed Dudurkayev, Mr Visarkhan Dokuyev and Mr Alu Bultayev were taken into custody by State agents on 16 July 2000 in Grozny. In view of the absence of any news of them since that date and the life-threatening nature of such detention (see paragraph 395 above), the Court also finds that Mr Apti Medzhidov, Mr Akhmed Dudurkayev, Mr Visarkhan Dokuyev and Mr Alu Bultayev may be presumed dead following their unacknowledged detention.3.
Conclusions433.
The Court finds that in all of the cases presently before it the applicants’ relatives were abducted by armed men in uniforms, displaying behaviour characteristic of servicemen carrying out security operations. Their behaviour and appearance, their ability to pass through roadblocks and to cordon off areas, along with their use of military-type vehicles even during curfew hours, lead the Court to conclude that, in all probability, they could be none other than State servicemen. The applicants’ allegations are supported by the witness statements collected by them and by the domestic investigations. In their submissions to the authorities the applicants maintained that their relatives had been abducted by State agents. The investigators accepted as fact the versions of events presented by the applicants and took steps to check whether State servicemen had been involved in the abductions.434.
In summary, the facts of all the applications contain sufficient evidence to enable the Court to make findings about the carrying out of security operations and thus about the State’s exclusive control over the detainees (see, among many others, Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, § 114). The Government’s arguments are in contradiction to the evidence reviewed by the Court and insufficient to discharge them of the burden of proof which has been shifted to them in these cases.435.
The detention in life-threatening circumstances of Mr Alikhan Sultygov, Mr Visadi Samrailov, Mr Ruslan Yandiyev, Mr Nurdi Isayev, Mr Anzor Idigov, Mr Idris Saayev, Mr Rustam Amerkhanov, Ms Milana Ozdoyeva, Mr Ezir-Ali Shakhbiyev, Mr Abzu Shakhbiyev, Mr Sayd‑Magomed Shakhbiyev, Mr Sharpudi Dubayev, Mr Magomed‑Salakh Tekhiyev, Mr Timerlan Cholayev, Mr Apti Medzhidov, Mr Akhmed Dudurkayev, Mr Visarkhan Dokuyev and Mr Alu Bultayev, together with the long absence of any news of them, leads the Court to conclude that they may be presumed dead.V.
ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 2 OF THE CONVENTION436.
The applicants complained, under Article 2 of the Convention, that their relatives had disappeared after having been detained by State agents and that the domestic authorities had failed to carry out effective investigations into the matter. Article 2 reads as follows:“1.
Everyone’s right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.2.
Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:(a)
in defence of any person from unlawful violence;(b)
in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;(c)
in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.”A.
The parties’ submissions437.
In their observations the Government contended in respect of the application Shakhbiyeva and Others (no. 62220/10) that Article 2 of the Convention was not applicable to the applicants’ complaints concerning the disappearance of their relatives and that their complaint under this head had to be examined under Article 5 of the Convention. To this end they referred to the case of Kurt v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, §§ 101-09, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998‑III. In respect of all the applications the Government submitted that the complaints should be rejected as manifestly ill-founded, as the applicants had failed to substantiate their allegations, and that the domestic investigations had not resulted in any evidence that the applicants’ relatives had been held under State control or that they were dead. The Government further noted that the mere fact that the investigative measures employed had not produced any specific results, or had produced only limited ones, did not mean that there had been any omissions on the part of the investigating authorities. They claimed that all the necessary steps were being taken to comply with the obligation to conduct an effective investigation.438.
The applicants maintained their complaints.B.
The Court’s assessment1.
Admissibility439.
The Court considers, in the light of the parties’ submissions, that the complaints raise serious issues of fact and law under the Convention the determination of which requires an examination of the merits. It also decides to join to the merits the issue of applicability of Article 2 of the Convention (see Khadayeva and Others v. Russia, no. 5351/04, § 114, 12 March 2009). The complaints under Article 2 of the Convention must therefore be declared admissible.2.
Merits(a)
Alleged violation of the right to life of the applicants’ relatives440.
The Court notes at the outset that it is undisputed by the parties that the whereabouts of the applicants’ relatives has been unaccounted for periods ranging between two and almost eleven years from the time of the events to the lodging of the applications with the Court. The question arises whether, as the Government submit, Article 2 of the Convention is applicable to the applicants’ situations.441.
The Court has previously held that Article 5 imposes an obligation on the State to account for the whereabouts of any person taken into detention and who has thus been placed under the control of the authorities (see Kurt, cited above, § 124). Whether a failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee’s fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on specific evidence, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (see Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 85, ECHR 1999-IV, and Ertak v. Turkey, no. 20764/92, § 131, ECHR 2000-V).442.
In this connection, the Court notes that the Government denied that the applicants’ relatives had been detained by State agents or had been under the control of the authorities after abduction. Therefore, the Government’s argument concerning the applicability of Article 5 of the Convention instead of Article 2 is inconsistent. However, leaving aside the contradictory nature of the Government’s position in this regard and assuming that the applicants’ abducted relatives were under the control of State agents after abduction, then the period of time which has elapsed since each person was placed in detention, although not decisive in itself, is a relevant factor to be taken into account. It must be accepted that the more time that goes by without any news of the detained person, the greater the likelihood that he or she has died. The passage of time may, along with other elements of circumstantial evidence before the Court, provide grounds to conclude that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. In this respect the Court considers that such a situation gives rise to issues which go beyond a mere “irregular detention” in violation of Article 5. Such an interpretation is in keeping with the effective protection of the right to life as afforded by Article 2, which ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention (see, among other authorities, Çakıcı cited above, § 86, and Timurtaş v. Turkey, no. 23531/94, § 83, ECHR 2000‑VI). Accordingly, the Court finds that Article 2 of the Convention applies and that the Government’s objection in this respect should be rejected.443.
Based on the above and noting that it has already been found that in all of the applications under examination the applicants’ relatives may be presumed dead following their unacknowledged detention by State agents, the Court finds, in the absence of any justification put forward by the Government, that their deaths can be attributed to the State and that there has been a violation of the substantive aspect of Article 2 of the Convention in respect of Mr Alikhan Sultygov, Mr Visadi Samrailov, Mr Ruslan Yandiyev, Mr Nurdi Isayev, Mr Anzor Idigov, Mr Idris Saayev, Mr Rustam Amerkhanov, Ms Milana Ozdoyeva, Mr Ezir-Ali Shakhbiyev, Mr Abzu Shakhbiyev, Mr Sayd-Magomed Shakhbiyev, Mr Sharpudi Dubayev, Mr Magomed-Salakh Tekhiyev, Mr Timerlan Cholayev, Mr Apti Medzhidov, Mr Akhmed Dudurkayev, Mr Visarkhan Dokuyev and Mr Alu Bultayev.(b)
Alleged inadequacy of the investigations into the abductions444.
The Court has already found that a criminal investigation does not constitute an effective remedy in respect of disappearances which have occurred, in particular, in Chechnya and Ingushetia between 1999 and 2006, and that such a situation constitutes a systemic problem under the Convention (see Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, § 217). In the case at hand, as in many previous similar cases reviewed by the Court, the investigations have been pending for many years without bringing about any significant developments as to the identities of the perpetrators or the fate of the applicants’ missing relatives. While the obligation to investigate effectively is one of means and not of results, the Court notes that each set of criminal proceedings has been plagued by a combination of the same defects as those enumerated in Aslakhanova and Others (cited above, §§ 123‑25). Each was subjected to several decisions to suspend the investigation, followed by periods of inactivity, which further diminished the prospects of solving the crimes. No meaningful steps have been taken to identify and question the servicemen who could have witnessed, registered or participated in the operations.445.
In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the authorities failed to carry out effective criminal investigations into the circumstances of the disappearance and death of Mr Alikhan Sultygov, Mr Visadi Samrailov, Mr Ruslan Yandiyev, Mr Nurdi Isayev, Mr Anzor Idigov, Mr Idris Saayev, Mr Rustam Amerkhanov, Ms Milana Ozdoyeva, Mr Ezir-Ali Shakhbiyev, Mr Abzu Shakhbiyev, Mr Sayd-Magomed Shakhbiyev, Mr Sharpudi Dubayev, Mr Magomed-Salakh Tekhiyev, Mr Timerlan Cholayev, Mr Apti Medzhidov, Mr Akhmed Dudurkayev, Mr Visarkhan Dokuyev and Mr Alu Bultayev. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in its procedural aspect.VI.
ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION446.
The applicants complained of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the mental suffering caused to them by the disappearance of their relatives. Article 3 reads:Article 3“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”A.
The parties’ submissions447.
The Government contested the applicants’ claims.448.
The applicants reiterated their complaints.B.
The Court’s assessment1.
Admissibility449.
The Court notes that the applicants’ complaints under this head are not manifestly ill‑founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible.2.
Merits450.
The Court observes that the question of whether a member of the family of a “disappeared person” is a victim of treatment contrary to Article 3 will depend on the existence of special factors which give the suffering of the applicants a dimension and character distinct from the emotional distress which may be regarded as inevitably caused to relatives of a victim of a serious human rights violation. Relevant elements will include the proximity of the family tie, the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question, the involvement of the family member in the attempts to obtain information about the disappeared person and the way in which the authorities responded to those enquiries. The Court would further emphasise that the essence of such a violation does not mainly lie in the fact of the “disappearance” of the family member but rather concerns the authorities’ reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention. It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities’ conduct (see Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, § 358, 18 June 2002, and Imakayeva v. Russia, no. 7615/02, ECHR 2006‑XIII, § 164).451.
In the present case the Court notes that the applicants are close relatives of the disappeared persons. For a number of years they have not had any news of their abducted family members. During this period the applicants have applied to various official bodies with enquiries about their relatives, both in writing and in person. Despite their attempts, the applicants have never received any plausible explanation or information as to what became of their family members following their abduction. The responses received by the applicants mostly denied that the State was responsible for their arrest or simply informed them that an investigation was ongoing. The Court’s findings concerning the systemic problem related to the procedural aspect of Article 2 are also of direct relevance here.452.
In view of the above, the Court finds that the applicants suffered distress and anguish as a result of the disappearance of their family members and their inability to find out what happened to them. The manner in which their complaints have been dealt with by the authorities must be considered to constitute inhuman treatment contrary to Article 3.VII.
ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION IN RESPECT OF MR ALIKHAN SULTYGOV AND MR VISADI SAMRAILOV (No. 42575/07).453.
The applicants in the application Sultygov and Others (no. 42575/07) further complained that their abducted relatives Mr Alikhan Sultygov and Mr Visadi Samrailov had been victims of a breach of Article 3 on account of the conditions of their detention after the abduction and the authorities’ failure to investigate those allegations.A.
The parties’ submissions454.
The Government contested the applicants’ claim.455.
The applicants maintained their complaint.B.
The Court’s assessment456.
The Court considers that this complaint is linked to those examined above and must therefore likewise be declared admissible. However, having regard to its findings under Article 2 of the Convention, the Court does not find it necessary to examine it separately.VIII.
ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 OF THE CONVENTION457.
The applicants further stated that their abducted relatives had been detained in violation of the guarantees of Article 5 of the Convention, which reads, in so far as relevant:“1.
Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law: ...(c)
the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;...2.
Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him.3.
Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.4.
Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.5.
Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an enforceable right to compensation.”A.
The parties’ submissions458.
The Government denied that the applicants’ relatives had been detained by State servicemen. In respect of the application Amerkhanova (no. 4560/08) they stated that Mr Rustam Amerkhanov had been taken to the Urus-Martan ROVD for a couple of hours and released.459.
The applicants reiterated the complaint.B.
The Court’s assessment1.
Admissibility460.
The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. It further notes that the complaint is not inadmissible on any other grounds and must therefore be declared admissible.2.
Merits461.
The Court has previously noted the fundamental importance of the guarantees contained in Article 5 to secure the right of individuals in a democracy to be free from arbitrary detention. It has also stated that unacknowledged detention is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a very grave violation of Article 5 (see Çiçek v. Turkey, no. 25704/94, § 164, 27 February 2001, and Luluyev and Others v. Russia, no. 69480/01, § 122, ECHR 2006-XIII (extracts)).462.
As for the Government’s contention, concerning the application Amerkhanova (no.4560/08), that Mr Rustam Amerkhanov was released after two hours, the Court notes that no evidence, such as records of detention or release, has been provided to it to corroborate this assertion. It therefore finds that he remained under the control of the authorities after being apprehended during the security operation.463.
Accordingly, the Court concludes that after being apprehended, the applicants’ relatives were held in unacknowledged detention, which was not logged in any custody records, and that there exists no official trace of their subsequent whereabouts or fate. In accordance with the Court’s practice, this must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, § 371).464.
The Court further considers that the authorities should have been more alert to the need for a thorough and prompt investigation of the applicants’ complaints that their relatives had been detained and taken away in life-threatening circumstances. However, the Court’s findings above in relation to Article 2 and, in particular, the conduct of the investigation leave no doubt that the authorities failed to take prompt and effective measures to safeguard them against the risk of disappearance.465.
In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that Mr Alikhan Sultygov, Mr Visadi Samrailov, Mr Ruslan Yandiyev, Mr Nurdi Isayev, Mr Anzor Idigov, Mr Idris Saayev, Mr Rustam Amerkhanov, Ms Milana Ozdoyeva, Mr Ezir-Ali Shakhbiyev, Mr Abzu Shakhbiyev, Mr Sayd-Magomed Shakhbiyev, Mr Sharpudi Dubayev, Mr Magomed-Salakh Tekhiyev, Mr Timerlan Cholayev, Mr Apti Medzhidov, Mr Akhmed Dudurkayev, Mr Visarkhan Dokuyev and Mr Alu Bultayev were held in unacknowledged detention without any of the safeguards contained in Article 5. This constitutes a particularly grave violation of the right to liberty and security enshrined in Article 5 of the Convention.IX.
ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION466.
The applicants argued that they had no available domestic remedies for the violations claimed, in particular those under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention. Article 13 reads:“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”467.
The Government disagreed with that submission, pointing to a number of instruments available to the applicants in the criminal proceedings and in Russian civil law.A.
Admissibility468.
The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.B.
Merits469.
The Court reiterates its findings concerning the general ineffectiveness of criminal investigations in cases such as those under examination. In the absence of the results of the criminal investigation, any other possible remedy becomes inaccessible in practice (see Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, §§ 151-57).470.
The Court thus finds that the applicants in these cases did not dispose of an effective domestic remedy for their grievances under Articles 2 and 3, in breach of Article 13 of the Convention.X.
ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 38 OF THE CONVENTION471.
The applicants in the application Sultygov and Others (no. 42575/07) alleged that the Government had failed to disclose the entire contents of the documents from the investigation file on the abduction of Mr Alikhan Sultygov and Mr Visadi Samrailov. Therefore, they invited the Court to find a violation of Article 38 of the Convention, which reads:“The Court shall examine the case together with the representatives of the parties and, if need be, undertake an investigation, for the effective conduct of which the High Contracting Parties concerned shall furnish all necessary facilities.”472.
The Court reiterates that it is of utmost importance for the effective operation of the system of individual petition instituted by Article 34 that States should furnish all the necessary facilities to make possible a proper and effective examination of applications (see Tanrıkulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, § 70, ECHR 1999‑IV, and Velikova v. Bulgaria, no. 41488/98, § 77, ECHR 2000‑VI). This obligation requires the Contracting States to furnish all necessary facilities to the Court, whether it is conducting a fact‑finding investigation or performing its general duties as regards the examination of applications. A failure on a Government’s part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well‑foundedness of the applicants’ allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 of the Convention (see Medova v. Russia, no. 25385/04, § 76, 15 January 2009, and Timurtaş, cited above, §§ 66 and 70).473.
Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that it asked the Government to produce such relevant documents from the investigation file which were capable of rebutting the applicants’ allegations that their missing relatives had been abducted by State servicemen, including witness statements. The Court also notes that the applicants furnished a number of copies of documents reflecting the contents of the criminal case file.474.
Having regard to the above, and to the conclusions as to the State’s responsibility for the abduction (see paragraph 443 above), the Court finds that the allegedly incomplete nature of certain documents and information did not prevent it from examining the application (see Gakayeva and Others, cited above, § 389, and Khatsiyeva and Others v. Russia, no. 5108/02, § 168, 17 January 2008).475.
There has, accordingly, been no failure to comply with Article 38 of the Convention.XI.
APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION476.
Article 41 of the Convention provides:“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”A.

The Government501.

As for the claims in respect of non-pecuniary damage, the Government stated that they were excessive and that a finding of a violation of the Convention would in itself comprise adequate compensation.B.
The applicants’ request for an investigation503.
The applicants in the application Sultygov and Others (no. 42575/07) also requested, referring to Article 41 of the Convention, that an independent investigation which would comply with the requirements of the Convention be conducted into the disappearance of their relatives.504.
Keeping in mind its findings in Aslakhanova and Others (cited above, §§ 220-38) concerning the systemic problem of ineffective investigations into disappearances in the region at the material time, along with its findings in a number of similar cases in which it has decided, with reference to its established principles, that it was most appropriate to leave it to the respondent Government to choose the means to be used in the domestic legal order with a view to discharging their legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Umayeva v. Russia, no. 1200/03, §§ 123-24, 4 December 2008; Kukayev v. Russia, no. 29361/02, §§ 131-34, 15 November 2007; Lyanova and Aliyeva v. Russia, nos. 2713/02 and 28440/03, § 160, 2 October 2008; Medova v. Russia, cited above, §§ 142-43; and Mutsolgova and Others v. Russia, no. 2952/06, § 168, 1 April 2010), the Court does not see any exceptional circumstances which would lead it to reach a different conclusion in the present case.C.

The applicants in the applications Idigov (no. 424/08) and Saayeva and Others (no. 3375/08) were represented by Mr D. Itslayev.

The Court’s assessment509.
The Court reiterates that there must be a clear causal connection between the damages claimed by applicants and the violation of the Convention, and that this may, where appropriate, include compensation in respect of loss of earnings. The Court further finds that the loss of earnings applies to close relatives of disappeared persons, including spouses, elderly parents and minor children (see, among other authorities, Imakayeva, cited above, § 213).510.
Wherever the Court finds a violation of the Convention, it may accept that the applicants have suffered non-pecuniary damage which cannot be compensated for solely by the findings of violations, and make a financial award.511.
As to costs and expenses, the Court has to establish first whether these costs and expenses were actually incurred and, second, whether they were necessary (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, § 220, Series A no. 324, and Fadeyeva v. Russia, no.
55723/00, § 147, ECHR 2005-IV).512.
Having regard to its above conclusions, the principles enumerated above and the parties’ submissions, the Court awards the amounts to the applicants as detailed in Appendix II, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicants on those amounts. The awards in respect of costs and expenses are to be paid into the representatives’ bank accounts, as specified by the applicants.E.
Default interest513.
