JOINDER OF THE APPLICATIONS26.
Having regard to the similar subject matter of the applications, the Court finds it appropriate to examine them jointly in a single judgment.II.
ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION27.
The applicants complained that their confinement in metal cages in courtrooms during the criminal proceedings against them had amounted to treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”In particular, the applicant in the first case complained about his confinement in the metal cage at the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Krasnoyarsk between 11 June and 11 November 2013 and between 14 February and 4 April 2014. The applicant in the second case complained about his confinement in the metal cage at the Leninskiy District Court of Cheboksary and the Supreme Court of the Chuvash Republic during the proceedings against him in 2014. The applicant in the third case complained about his confinement in the metal cage when appearing before the Cherepovets Town Court of the Vologda Region when the custodial measure was applied to him, when it was subsequently extended and during the trial.A.
Admissibility28.
The Court notes that these complaints are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible.B.
Merits1.
The parties’ submissions29.
The Government noted that the Court had already dealt with the issue of the use of metal cages in courtrooms in Svinarenko and Slyadnev (cited above) and found that such a practice constituted in itself an affront to human dignity and amounted to degrading treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention. In view of the Court’s position on the matter, the Government acknowledged that there had been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in the present three applications.30.
The applicants maintained their complaints and took note of the Government’s admission.2.
The Court’s assessment31.
The Court takes note of the Government’s acknowledgment of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. In those circumstances, and having regard to its case-law (see Svinarenko and Slyadnev, cited above, §§ 122-39, and Urazov v. Russia, no. 42147/05, §§ 81-83, 14 June 2016), the Court finds no reason to hold otherwise. It therefore concludes that the applicants’ confinement in metal cages in courtrooms amounted to degrading treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention. There has accordingly been a violation of that provision.III.
APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION32.
Article 41 of the Convention provides:“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”33.
The applicant in the first case claimed 3,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, while the applicants in the second and third cases claimed EUR 20,000 under the same head. The applicant in the second case also claimed EUR 4,000 in legal fees for his representation by Mr Pavlov in the proceedings before the Court.34.
The Government submitted that the applicants’ claims under Article 41 of the Convention were to be considered and determined in accordance with the Court’s established case-law.35.
As to non-pecuniary damage, having regard to the violation of the Convention found and making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the first applicant EUR 3,000 and the second and third applicants EUR 7,500 each in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on those amounts.36.
As regards the claim by the applicant in the second case for costs and expenses, the Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the second applicant the sum of EUR 1,000 for costs and expenses in the proceedings before the Court, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant on that amount.37.
The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT, UNANIMOUSLY,1.
Decides to join the applications; 2.
Declares the complaints concerning the applicants’ confinement in metal cages during the criminal proceedings against them admissible; 3.
Holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention; 4.
