Rules of Court B, which came into force on 2 October 1994, applyto all cases concerning the States bound by Protocol No. 9 (P9).________________ PROCEDURE 1.      The case was referred to the Court by the European Commissionof Human Rights ("the Commission") and by the Government of theKingdom of Norway ("the Government") on 1 March and 3 April 1995respectively, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47).  Itoriginated in an application (no. 17383/90) against Norway lodged withthe Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Norwegian citizen,Ms Adele Johansen, on 10 October 1990.         The Commission's request and the Government's applicationreferred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48); the request alsoreferred to the declaration whereby Norway recognised the compulsoryjurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46).  The object of therequest and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whetherthe facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of itsobligations under Articles 6, 8 and 13 of the Convention (art. 6,art. 8, art. 13). 2.      In response to the enquiry made in accordance withRule 35 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court B, the applicant stated that shewished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer whowould represent her (Rule 31). 3.      The Chamber to be constituted included ex officioMr R. Ryssdal, the elected judge of Norwegian nationality (Article 43of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R.

As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Bernhardt,acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government,the applicant's lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on theorganisation of the proceedings (Rules 39 para. 1 and 40).  Pursuantto the orders made in consequence on 6 June and 13 November 1995, theRegistrar received the applicant's and the Government's memorials on13 and 20 November 1995.  On 20 December 1995 the Secretary to theCommission indicated that the Delegate did not wish to reply inwriting. 5.      On various dates between 10 January and 19 June 1996 theRegistrar received a number of documents from the Government and theapplicant, including particulars on the latter's Article 50 (art. 50)claims. 6.      On 10 and 12 January 1996, the Registrar received from theGovernment a request that the memorials and appendices thereto not bemade accessible to the public and that the hearing on 23 January beheld in camera.  The applicant and the Delegate of the Commissionsubmitted their comments on 16 and 17 January.  On 19 and 22 Januarythe Government and the applicant accepted that the hearing be held inpublic subject, inter alia, to the non-disclosure of the identity ofcertain persons, including the applicant's daughter. 7.      In accordance with the President's decisions, the hearing tookplace in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 January 1996, inpublic, in accordance with the terms indicated above.  The Court hadheld a preparatory meeting beforehand.         There appeared before the Court: (a)  for the Government      Mr T. Stabell, Assistant Attorney-General        (Civil Matters),                                       Agent,     Mr F. Elgesem, Attorney, Attorney-General's Office        (Civil Matters),     Ms T. Smith, Assistant Director-General, The Royal        Ministry of Child and Family Affairs,     Ms K. Ofstad, Adviser, The Royal Ministry of        Child and Family Affairs,                           Advisers; (b)  for the Commission      Mrs G.H. Thune,                                        Delegate; (c)  for the applicant      Mrs S. Moland, advokat,                                 Counsel,     Mrs K. Næss, advokat,                                   Adviser,     Mr  A. Salomonsen,                                    Assistant.         The Court heard addresses by Mrs Thune, Mrs Moland, Mrs Næssand Mr Stabell. 8.      On 26 June 1996 the President decided that the Government's andthe applicant's memorials, subject to changes to the former, be madeaccessible to the public but that those appendices thereto whichrelated to the domestic proceedings not be made so accessible(see paragraph 6 above).         On the same date, he also decided to authorise the filing ofthe applicant's letters of 16 and 22 January 1996, with theirenclosures, but to refuse that of the letter and enclosures receivedon 19 January (Rule 39 para. 1, third sub-paragraph, ofRules of Court B). AS TO THE FACTS I.      Particular circumstances of the case    A.   Background 9.      The applicant, who was born at Laksevåg near Bergen, left homewhen she was 16. In 1977, when she was 17 years old, she gave birth toher son C. and they became dependent on assistance from the socialwelfare authorities.  From 1980 onwards the applicant cohabited witha man who mistreated her and C.  He was convicted of drug offences in1983 and spent two years in prison.  On many occasions the socialwelfare authorities assisted the applicant in the upbringing of C., butconsiderable problems as well as friction arose between thoseauthorities and the applicant.  In August 1988 C. began to receivetreatment at the Child Psychiatric Department of Haukeland Hospital inBergen.  In January 1989 he was admitted to a special school adaptedto his needs. 10.     On 14 November 1989 C., who was then 12 years old, wasprovisionally taken into care under section 11 of the Child Welfare Act(Barnevernsloven) no. 14 of 17 July 1953 ("the 1953 Act"; seeparagraph 33 below), as the circumstances of the case disclosed adanger to his health and development.  The police assisted the childwelfare authorities in enforcing the decision.  After spending theperiod from November 1989 to early January 1990 at theChild Psychiatric Department of Haukeland Hospital, C. was placed ina children's home.         According to a statement of 10 January 1990 by theChief Physician, Ms Guri Rogge, and the Deputy Chief Physician,Mr Arne Hæggernes, the applicant's and C.'s situation had been "ratherchaotic" throughout the period during which they had been in contactwith the hospital.  When faced with difficulties, the applicant hadbroken off her contact with the system which had been set up to assisther.  Her way of life had had a detrimental effect on C. and the factthat he had changed schools had created much insecurity. 11.     In mid-November 1989 the applicant, who was pregnant, leftBergen for Oslo.  On 23 November she was given accommodation at theOslo Crisis Centre, an institution for women who had been victims ofdomestic ill-treatment.         On the following day she went for an antenatal check-up atMarkveien Medical Centre in Oslo.  She stated to the doctor concernedthat she had been taking valium, vival and paralgin during herpregnancy and that she had hardly eaten during the last fortnight.Because of her pregnancy and her state of health she was subsequentlyreferred to Ullevål Hospital in Oslo.  The doctors there considered herphysical and mental state of health to be very poor, but refrained fromcontacting the child welfare authorities, fearing that she might injureherself if they did so.    B.   Public-care measures in respect of the applicant's        second child 12.     On 7 December 1989 the applicant gave birth to her daughter S.In view of the applicant's difficult situation and the problems withregard to the upbringing of C., the child welfare authorities(barnevernet) at Røa in Oslo were contacted.  At a meeting on8 December 1989 between the applicant and her lawyer and the childwelfare authorities the applicant's and S.'s situation was discussed.         On 13 December 1989 the Chairperson of the Client and PatientCommittee of Røa, district 24 (klient- og pasientutvalget i bydel 24,Røa - "the Committee"), decided to take S. provisionally into careunder section 11 of the Child Welfare Act (see paragraph 33 below) onthe grounds that the applicant, because of her physical and mentalstate of health, was considered incapable of taking care of herdaughter.  The Chairperson considered that the child would be put atrisk if the decision were not implemented immediately.         In reaching the above decision, the Chairperson had regard tothe decision by the social welfare authorities in Bergen to take theapplicant's son provisionally into care and their intention of doingso on a permanent basis, as well as their concern for the situation ofthe baby whom they considered taking into care immediately after birth.The Chairperson also took into account information provided byMarkveien Medical Centre, by Ullevål Hospital and by those who hadattended the meeting on 8 December 1989.         The applicant did not lodge any appeal against this provisionalcare decision. 13.     On 19 December 1989, in accordance with the above decision, S.was placed in a short-term foster home linked to theAline Child Care Centre.  The applicant was allowed to visit her twicea week at the Centre.  She did not challenge this access arrangement,which was not based on any formal decision. 14.     The question of public care was brought before the Committeeon 29 December 1989.  The Committee obtained an expert opinion dated13 February 1990 from Mr Knut Rønbeck, psychologist, which containedthe following conclusion on the applicant's ability to take care of S.:         "... On the surface, she appears to be a well-organised,        friendly and charming young woman.  On meeting her, it may        therefore initially be difficult to understand that the child        welfare authorities and mental health authorities have had        such serious problems in achieving cooperation with her for        the benefit of her son.  If one approaches her more closely,        however, a clear picture emerges of a woman with major        unsolved mental problems which strongly affect her social        functioning and her ability to care [for a child].  The        problems are expressed in the form of anxiety and depression.        Since her early youth, she has functioned fairly marginally        from a social point of view.  For many years, she lived with        a man who she herself believes abused both her and her son,        but without being able to break out of this relationship.         ...         ... Having regard to [the applicant's] history in respect of        taking care of her child and due to her lack of knowledge        of/denial of her own faults vis-à-vis her own and [C.'s]        problems I regret that, as the expert in this case, I am not        hopeful about her future ability to take care of her children,        although she undoubtedly loves them and is attached to them.        In addition to these points [I] must add that [the applicant]        now realises that what the future holds in store is the        prospect of being a mother on her own in Oslo where she lacks        support from a social environment.         ...         The child in this case [S.] is in a period of her life where        the attachment to preferably stable persons ought to develop.        It is of decisive importance for her personal development that        she now gets the opportunity to attach herself to persons whom        she may regard during her adolescence as stable and secure        parents." 15.     The applicant requested the appointment of a second expert.Since the child welfare authorities refused her request, the applicantherself engaged a psychologist, Mrs Lise Valla, who submitted heropinion on 17 April 1990.  This concluded:         "... I cannot find that there are sufficient reasons for        depriving [the applicant] of the care of her children [C.] and        [S.].         In my view [the applicant] shows responsibility when it comes        to considering the children's adolescence - and she is also a        person who may learn from the mistakes she has made.         It is clear, however, that [the applicant] will need some        practical assistance in the future.  It is desirable that both        she and [C.] receive therapy in order to manage the emotional        gaps from the bad years - and I would consider it reasonable        that the public authorities should provide this.  Furthermore,        [the applicant] ought to receive support so that she can        improve her level of education."         The above opinion was based on available documents and meetingswith the applicant and her son. 16.     In the meantime the child welfare authorities at Røa continuedtheir examination of the case.  Their report to the Committee of30 March 1990, based on, among other material, talks with theapplicant, Mr Rønbeck's opinion and the case files of the child welfareauthorities in Bergen and Oslo, stated that if S. were to be reunitedwith her mother, the child's mental health would be subjected to harmor serious danger and she would live under such conditions as describedin section 16 (a) of the Child Welfare Act (see paragraph 32 below).The report recommended that S. be taken into compulsory care pursuantto section 19 of the Act, such measures being necessary in view of theapplicant's inability to provide satisfactory care for her daughter andof the fact that the preventive care measures taken under section 18of the Act in respect of her son C. had not been effective(see paragraphs 33-34 below).  The report further recommended that S.be placed in a foster home with a view to adoption.  Scientificexperience in recent years had shown that remaining a long-term fosterchild instead of being adopted was disadvantageous for the child: thefoster parents could at any time cancel the agreement or the parentsmight institute proceedings in order to be reunited with the child.Adoption had the advantage of clarifying the situation and of creatingsecurity and stability for the child and the adoptive parents.Moreover, the report stated that, in order to secure the child'sdevelopment and its relationship with the persons who would permanentlyassume the care, it would be appropriate for the authorities to deprivethe applicant of all her parental responsibilities (foreldreansvaret)pursuant to section 20 of the Act (see paragraph 35 below).         As regards the question of access, the report added:         "While the girl has been at the Child Care Centre [the        applicant] has had access to her twice a week for one hour.        Following transfer of the girl to an approved foster home with        a view to adoption it is recommended that access be refused        and the address kept secret.         [The applicant] has previously tried to disappear with her son        in order to avoid the social welfare authorities and she did        not inform the social welfare office/authorities when her son        ran away from the children's home at Bergen in February 1990        in order to stay with her.  Therefore, it is considered not        unlikely that she would intervene in a disturbing manner in        the foster home, and perhaps also try to take the girl with        her.         It is considered important for this child to have quiet and        stability in the new environment where she is placed.  The        social welfare authorities will accordingly recommend that        [the applicant] be refused contact with the child and that the        child's new address be kept secret.         Today the girl has no relationship with her mother and,        therefore, it will not be necessary to phase out the access        arrangement before the girl is transferred to the foster        home." 17.     On 2 May 1990 the Committee, chaired by aMrs Justice Inger Kristine Moksnes of the Oslo City Court (byrett),examined the case.  The applicant, assisted by a lawyer, calledthree witnesses and the child welfare authorities called one witness.Mr Rønbeck, the appointed expert, was heard, but not Mrs Valla, theexpert engaged by the applicant herself.  As the costs in respect ofMrs Valla's appearance were not covered by the State, she was not ableto attend the hearing.         A request by the applicant's counsel to be assisted byMr Reidar Larssen, a psychiatrist, as a representative was rejected bythe Committee on the ground that the applicant was already represented.He was, however, allowed to appear as a witness and to attend thehearing thereafter with no right to address the Committee.         The opinions of Mr Rønbeck and Mrs Valla and the child welfareauthorities' report of 30 March 1990 were available to the Committee.         On the basis of the information and evidence submitted to itthe Committee decided on 3 May 1990, by four votes to two, to take S.into care; to deprive the applicant of her parental responsibilities(which as a result were transferred to the child welfare authorities);to place S. in a foster home with a view to adoption; to refuse themother access as from the moment of the child's placement in thefoster home and to keep the latter's address secret.  In its decisionthe Committee stated:         "With reference to the reports which have been submitted and        the submissions made during this meeting, the Committee's        majority, Mrs Ryberg, Mr Clausen, Mr Aasland and Mrs Moksnes,        finds that [the applicant] has very little chance of acting        satisfactorily in taking care of her daughter.  The majority        stresses that [the applicant] has had sole responsibility for        the maintenance and care of her son, born in 1977.  This task        she has not managed and the social welfare authorities have        taken this child into care.  The [applicant] has received        special assistance since 1977 and has lived off social        security benefits since her son was 10 years old.  She has        only worked for short periods.  She has not lived with the        fathers of her two children but had for several years a        cohabitant who ill-treated her and her son, both physically        and mentally.  He was part of the drugs scene in Bergen, as        she was at one time. He is now in prison, serving a sentence        for drug dealing.  She has herself used drugs and alcohol and        has had intoxication problems.  It is unclear how big a        problem this has been, but the Committee assumes that she has        no intoxication problems at present.  It is not quite clear,        however, whether the problem has been solved also for the        future.         [The applicant] now maintains that she has broken with her        former friend and her previous life.  She has moved to Oslo        and now appears to have a different lifestyle than the one in        Bergen.  She has made a few social contacts but these are        dependent on circumstances and cannot be of decisive        importance.  She has vague plans for the future, although she        expresses a wish to train as a nursing auxiliary.         However, the majority is of the opinion that the decisive        factor in this case must be that, according to the appointed        expert, [the applicant] has serious unsolved mental problems        which impair her social skills and her ability to take care        [of children]. Although her son has had considerable mental        problems she has not been able to cooperate with the        authorities and has not understood the necessity of giving his        needs priority over her own.  She has not been able to        understand that the boy needed help and has not been willing        to accept assistance either.  The majority fears that this        attitude may lead to her daughter's needs not being met either        if she remains with [the applicant]. The majority finds that        the daughter will live in such conditions that the        requirements of section 16 (a) of the Child Welfare Act are        fulfilled.         In connection with taking her son into care a number of        measures have been tried, and the majority therefore finds        that measures under section 18 would be ineffective.  The        requirements for care under section 19 are accordingly        fulfilled.  The majority also finds that the requirements        pursuant to section 20 of the Child Welfare Act are fulfilled.        [The applicant] is not particularly motivated to accept        treatment and there is little prospect of change in this        respect.  The majority accordingly finds that it would be in        the interest of the child to be placed in a foster home with        a view to adoption.  The next few years will be crucial for        the child and it is preferable that she should feel certain        that she will not be moved.  It is of decisive importance for        the girl that she can now be attached to stable persons whom        she may regard as stable and secure parents in her        adolescence.         This is of decisive importance for the development of her        personality.  Therefore she ought not to be exposed to a        foster-home agreement which may be revoked.  She also ought to        form close relationships with a small number of people and         therefore ought to remain at a secret address pursuant to        section 19 of the Child Welfare Act, so that [the applicant]        no longer has access to her daughter when she is placed with        foster parents." 18.     The minority of the Committee found that the applicant'ssituation in life had improved since her removal from Bergen to Osloand that she should thus be given the opportunity to take charge of thecare of her daughter while staying at a special institution for thatpurpose. 19.     After her daughter's birth the applicant moved to a flat inOslo.  During the spring of 1990, her son C. twice ran away from thechildren's home in Bergen to join her in Oslo and, on thesecond occasion, she indicated that she would not comply with the caredecision.  As C. did not want to return to Bergen and as the applicantconsidered that the social welfare authorities there did not do enoughto help him, she decided to let C. stay in Oslo.  She managed to gethim admitted to a school there and she contacted a psychiatrist forsupport. 20.     On 24 April 1990 it was decided to take C. permanently intocare but on 19 June that care decision was lifted, notwithstanding thefact that his care situation was still considered to be detrimental tohis physical and psychological development, a matter which continuedto be of great concern to the authorities.  The conflict between theauthorities, on the one hand, and the applicant and her son, on theother, had made it impossible to implement the care decision withoutit being even more detrimental to the boy.  The decision of 19 June wassubsequently confirmed by the Hordaland County Governor (Fylkesmannen)on 13 March 1991.  C. has lived with the applicant since May 1990.    C.   Applicant's appeals against the care measures in respect of S. 21.     On 25 May 1990 the applicant's lawyer received the minutes ofthe Committee's meeting of 2 May 1990 leading to its decision of3 May 1990.  As regards the taking into public care and the deprivationof her parental responsibilities, the applicant lodged an appeal on28 May 1990 against the decision of 3 May with the County Governor forOslo and Akershus.  As far as the restrictions on access wereconcerned, she requested the County Governor to give the appealsuspensive effect (oppsettende virkning).  She submitted thatcontinuing access was decisive for maintaining contact between her andthe child pending the appeal.  The applicant also sent a copy of herappeal to the Committee, which on 28 June 1990 decided to uphold thedecision of 3 May 1990 and to refer the case to the County Governor. 22.     On 31 July 1990 the County Governor, referring to section 42of the Public Administration Act (Forvaltningsloven) of10 February 1967 decided not to give the appeal suspensive effect onthe grounds that it would be in the girl's best interests if thedecision of 3 May 1990 to terminate access were implemented as from themoment the child was placed in the foster home.         S. was placed with foster parents on 30 May 1990.  Theapplicant has not had access to or seen her daughter since. 23.     The applicant pursued her appeal against the care decision andthe deprivation of parental responsibilities.  As she was informed thather appeal to the County Governor of 28 May 1990 would remain pendingfor four to five months, she instituted proceedings in theOslo City Court.  She asked the court to set aside the Committee'sdecision of 3 May 1990, maintaining inter alia that it was crucial thather case be examined speedily, given that she had been refused accessto her daughter.  On 24 October 1990 the City Court dismissed (avviste)the application as such actions could only be instituted subsequent toa decision in the matter by the County Governor.  On 17 January 1991the High Court (Lagmannsretten) rejected an appeal by the applicant onthe ground that the County Governor had in the meantime decided thecase (see paragraph 24 below) and there was therefore no reason to dealwith the appeal.  A further appeal to the Supreme Court (Høyesterett)was rejected on 7 March 1991. 24.     On 9 November 1990, after a meeting with the applicant and herlawyer, the County Governor for Oslo and Akershus upheld theCommittee's decision concerning care and parental responsibilities. 25.     On 13 November 1990 the applicant instituted proceedingsagainst the Ministry of Child and Family Affairs(Barne- og familiedepartementet) in the Oslo City Court underChapter 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure (tvistemålsloven, Law no. 6of 13 August 1915 -see paragraph 38 below), asking for the caredecision to be lifted and to be reunited with her daughter.  In thealternative she requested that her parental responsibilities berestored.         On 20 December 1990 the defendant Ministry submittedobservations in reply. 26.     After consulting the parties, the City Court appointed twoexperts on 1 February 1991 to evaluate the applicant's ability to takecare of her daughter and the consequences of revoking the care decisionand/or restoring the applicant's parental responsibilities.  Theexperts were requested to submit their opinions by 15 March 1991, whichthey did.         On 8 February 1991 the parties were informed that the case hadbeen set down for 2 April 1991. 27.     The City Court, sitting with one specially appointed judge,Mr Idar E. Pettersen, heard the case between 2 and 5 April 1991.Having heard the applicant, represented by counsel, a representativeof the defendant Ministry, eleven witnesses and the two appointedexperts, the City Court, in a judgment of 16 April 1991, upheld thetaking into care and the deprivation of parental responsibilities.  Itgave the following reasons:         "According to the Child Welfare Act the starting-point is that        a child should grow up with his or her natural parents.  The        interests of the child may, however, warrant exceptions being        made to this general rule as it cannot be interpreted so as to        allow the child to be subjected to considerable harm.         In reviewing a compulsory measure imposed under the        Child Welfare Act the courts must as a starting-point rely on        the circumstances obtaining at the time of passing judgment.        The possible negative effects on the child of being returned        from the foster parents to the natural parents must be taken        into consideration.  Regard must also be had to the fact that        the Child Welfare Committee [barnevernsnemnda] and the        County Governor may lawfully maintain a decision to take the        child into care even if the circumstances on which the        decision was based have later changed to such an extent that        the conditions for intervention pursuant to the        Child Welfare Act are no longer fulfilled.         After hearing the evidence the Court finds that such material        conditions [ytre betingelser] obtain as would allow the        applicant today to give her daughter, born on 7 December 1989,        an acceptable upbringing.  In this respect there has been an        improvement in the situation since the child welfare        authorities took over the care of the daughter.  [The        applicant] now appears to be permanently settled in Oslo        together with the father of her oldest child who also lives        with her.  It appears quite clear that the applicant has great        concern for the child who has been taken from her.  There can        hardly be any doubt that it is her intention to arrange things        as far as possible in order to assume the care of the child,        if she were to be returned to the mother, to the best of her        abilities.  These being the facts in the present case, the        Court must examine whether returning the child from the foster        parents to her natural mother would entail a real danger of        harm to the child.         We have before us a case where the mother had the care taken        away from her shortly after birth.  The mother has since had        very little contact with the child and is now a stranger to        her.         The experts appointed by the City Court are both in agreement        that the child would be in a critical situation if returned.        On this point, Mrs Seltzer, psychologist, states in her expert        opinion:             'She is today in the middle of a phase of development of            her personal autonomy which, in order for her to develop            without complications, depends on secure conditions and            stable emotional continuity.  In the short term there can            be no doubt that the child would react with sorrow and            emotion if she were now to be removed from her foster            home.  In the long run it is likely that if she were            removed at this stage of her development she would carry            with her into her future life an experience of insecurity            vis-à-vis other people, including those who represent            close and dear relations.'         The experts stress that a return in these circumstances would        entail a particular risk. This is so because [the child] has        twice already in her short life experienced a removal from her        natural mother, first shortly after birth and then at the age        of seven months when she was moved from the        [Child Care Centre] to her present foster parents.  She would        therefore be particularly sensitive to further changes.         The child now lives under secure and stimulating conditions        with her foster family and, as the situation appears to the        Court, it is considered that the foster parents can give her        a safer upbringing than she would receive from her natural        mother.  Furthermore, in the Court's view there is a real        danger that the mother will not be able to deal adequately ...        with the return of her child in a crisis.  The mother's        history and previous contact with the public-support system        indicate that when, in such a pressing and threatening        situation, she needs help from that system, she will defend        herself with fear and aggression.  It was in particular        Mr Reigstad, psychologist, who emphasised this.  During his        oral explanations to the Court he has maintained the views        which he expressed in his written opinion but has also in his        oral explanations submitted further details concerning the        mother's personality.  He is of the opinion that the mother        makes a projective identification.  This means that she has        divided her world into two parts, one with friends and another        with enemies.  Towards those whom she recognises as friends        she shows a secure and nice side of herself, whilst to those        whom she considers to be against her she reacts with deep        suspicion, fear and aggression.  In Mr Reigstad's opinion, in        such a situation the mother will consider the public-support        system to be against her and will meet it with a        correspondingly negative attitude.  This will place an        additional burden on the child and harm her permanently in the        form of a split character.         The expert witnesses called by the mother have all had a very        good impression of her.  This goes for Mr Terje Torgersen,        doctor, Mrs Lise Valla, psychologist, and Mr Reidar Larsen,        psychiatrist.  A common element for these persons is, however,        that none of them have had a patient-doctor relationship with        [the applicant].  Those who have been appointed by the child        welfare authorities and the Court, Mr Knut Rønbeck,        psychologist, Mrs Wenche Seltzer, psychologist and        Mr Ståle Reigstad, psychologist, have all found the mother to        be more complex.  The Court considers that the appointed        experts, on the basis of their terms of reference and their        contacts with [the applicant] and others, have had the best        opportunity to evaluate her as a person.  The Court has        therefore considerable hesitations about departing from [their        assessment].  The Court has examined the [assessment] in the        light of the other submissions in the case and, not least, the        basic principles of the Act on the lifting of a care decision.         In the Court's view the experts have done a very thorough job.        The conclusions are clear and appear well-founded.  Their        statements confirm and elaborate the overall impression        which the Court has formed of the case.  The Court, therefore,        considering the case as a whole, will base its decision on the        experts' assessment.  In the Court's opinion, there is nothing        in the case to suggest that it should depart from their        assessment.         In the light of the above the Court finds that, because of the        likely reactions of the child to changes to her environment,        it would be a particularly demanding task for the mother to        assume the care of her.  In view of what is known about the        mother's present situation and her history it is unlikely that        she will be able to cooperate with the social assistance        provided by society without friction. Accordingly, having        regard to the concrete circumstances of the case as a whole,        the Court reaches the conclusion that the County Governor's,        and thus also the social welfare authorities', decision to        take the child into care should be upheld.         The next question is whether the decision should be limited to        the taking into care or should also cover parental        responsibilities pursuant to section 20 of the        Child Welfare Act.  In this respect the Court points out that        it is clear that section 20 has been applied with a view to        adoption.  The foster parents wish to adopt [the child] and in        view of the information available to it the Court assumes        that, unless the present decision is limited to taking into        care, adoption will be the end result.         The Court considers that for it to apply ... section 20, it        must be satisfied that this is necessary in order to secure        proper care for the child.  What is required will depend on        the purpose of depriving the parents of their parental        responsibilities and the situation in general.  If the aim is        to free the child for adoption, very weighty reasons are        required.  Section 20 may be applied with a view to adoption        only in very special circumstances.  It must be a condition        that the parents will be unable to give the child appropriate        care and that this would be a permanent situation.  When        parental responsibilities are taken away with a view to        adoption the question arises whether the child and the natural        parents should be permanently deprived of contact with each        other, with the consequences for reunification which that        entails.         In the Court's opinion a condition for the transfer of        parental responsibilities with a view to adoption is that it        is obvious that the child cannot in the foreseeable future be        reunited with the parents.  In the present case, both        appointed experts have recommended to the Court that the        child's placement in the foster home be made permanent.  One        of [them], [Mr] Reigstad, states in this respect:             `Assessment of the question of parental responsibilities            and adoption             When considering this question in the present case we            find, in addition to the general consideration that in            such cases adoption is always an advantage for the child,            concrete and real reasons militating in favour of            adoption.             The applicant's problems are in my view long-standing and            well established in her overall character.  They can be            documented back to 1977 and have been almost constantly            present during her entire adult life.  It follows that she            is unlikely to solve them in the foreseeable future and            that the situation therefore has a certain permanent            character.             In addition, were the applicant to be given access to the            foster home she would in all likelihood destroy the home's            security and make it unsuitable as a foster home for the            child.  This must be seen in the light of the crusade the            applicant has led over the last years against the child            care authorities and of the fact that she has clearly            stated that her aim is to get her daughter back.  In            addition, the fact that she earlier hid her son from the            child care authorities in Bergen and was supported in this            by her lawyers in Oslo on the whole gives very little            reason for optimism in respect of her future cooperation            with the foster home.             I have therefore reached the conclusion that it would be            in the interest of the daughter to remain in the            foster home and that permission be granted to adopt her so            that [the foster parents] also acquire the parental            responsibilities.             Having regard to my terms of reference, my conclusion is            accordingly:             Conclusion             A.  If the daughter were to be reunited with her natural            mother there is a considerable danger that she would not            recover from her separation crisis, which would cause her            permanent harm.  There are also objective grounds for            doubting that the mother would be capable of ensuring that            the daughter receives such necessary medical and            psychological assistance as she needs.  For these reasons            I cannot recommend to the Court that the child and her            natural mother be reunited.             B.  I assume that the aim of letting a natural mother keep            her parental responsibilities in respect of a child placed            in a foster home is to allow her access to the home and to            participate in, or take, important decisions regarding the            child.  In the circumstances, access to the foster home or            even lifting of the secrecy of the home's address would            destroy the security of the foster parents and make the            home unsuitable as a foster home.  In both the short and            the long run this would be detrimental to the child.             C.  In my view the best solution from the child's point of            view would be to deprive the mother of her parental            responsibilities and to allow the foster family to adopt            the child.  This would secure the child a stable and            appropriate upbringing and would bind the child to its new            family without reservation.'         In this regard, the other expert, [Mrs] Seltzer, states:             `If the child remains in the foster home and the            foster parents continue to act as the [child's]            foster parents, I consider that it would be impractical            and possibly complicating if a person other than the            foster parents were to assume parental responsibilities.            I consider also that it would be in the best interests of            the child for her to belong, fully, formally and            uninterruptedly to one place.  In addition one cannot            disregard the fact that an arrangement dividing the care            and the parental responsibilities may create insecurity            and represent a potential source of conflict between the            adults, with the child in between.  In certain            circumstances it can also be difficult to manage the daily            care in a satisfactory manner if the parental            responsibilities are assumed by another party.  If the            Court nevertheless decides to split the daily care and            parental responsibilities, this requires good cooperation            between the parties, something which at present cannot be            taken for granted having regard to the fact that the            foster parents and the natural mother have not met each            other.  I recommend that the daily care and the parental            responsibilities be entrusted to those who have the daily            care of the child.'         Both experts, in their oral submissions to the Court, have        stated that their views have been strengthened by the        submissions made during the examination of the case.         As regards the question whether the mother would be able to        give the child proper care on a permanent basis, [Mr] Reigstad        states that the mother lacks today and will lack in the        foreseeable future the necessary ability to do so.        [Mr] Rønbeck was of the same opinion when he submitted his        report in connection with the case.  [Mrs] Seltzer for her        part is of the opinion that today the mother is probably        capable, in favourable and clear circumstances, of taking care        of the child but the mother's situation is uncertain.  She        suggests therefore that it would be in the child's interests        to stay where she is.             As the Court understands the expert evidence, it is        obvious that the mother could not properly take care of the        child on a permanent basis.  Also as regards the question of        parental responsibilities, the Court attaches decisive weight        to the experts' assessment.  The Court further agrees with the        experts that allowing the [applicant] access to the        foster home would entail a real danger of conflict between the        foster parents and the natural mother.  The Court refers in        this connection to what has been said about the mother's ways        of reacting.  It follows that there are strong and real        factors militating in favour of adoption.  The special        interests which might weigh against adoption in the present        case cannot in the opinion of the Court be decisive.  The        Court here points out that the natural mother is a stranger to        the child, who, as far as the Court has been informed, has not        had any particular contact with the mother.  After a general,        concrete evaluation the Court has accordingly reached the        conclusion that the decision concerning the transfer of        parental responsibilities shall also be maintained." 28.     On 28 May 1991 the applicant lodged an appeal with theSupreme Court.  The defendant Ministry filed a reply on 19 June 1991.On 23 August 1991 the applicant was requested to submit furtherobservations by 6 September 1991, which she did on 5 September 1991.On 19 September 1991 the Appeals Committee of the Supreme Court(Høyesteretts Kjæremålsutvalg) refused leave to appeal.     D.  Subsequent developments 29.     In the spring of 1991 the applicant moved to Nørreballe,Denmark.  She now lives there with C.'s father.  C. now lives nearCopenhagen where he works.  The applicant gave birth to asecond daughter on 14 December 1991.  According to theDanish authorities this child has developed well.  A second son wasborn in 1993.  The applicant's daughter S. is still living with herfoster parents.  No decision concerning her adoption has yet beentaken.         A report of 30 January 1994 by Mrs An-Magritt Aanonsen,psychologist, which is favourable both to the applicant and to thefoster parents, concluded:         "1. Both mother and child today seem to be doing well.  The        mother is cohabiting in a steady relationship with the father        of three of her four children.  She seems to give satisfactory        care to her children and copes well with her everyday        situation and has managed to handle problems which have arisen        without any special help.         The child has formed a strong primary attachment to her        foster parents who provide her with good conditions for        growing up and who appear genuinely fond of her and very        committed.         2. In the previous section, I discussed the consequences of        establishing a right of contact.  Given the child's situation        today it is not desirable to establish a right of access at        present unless there is some change in the conditions of care        placement.  It is desirable for the child to have the greatest        possible continuity and stability, something that is best        achieved by permanent placement with her present carers.         3. I have also discussed above the consequences of        establishing a right of access with respect to the child's        care position and the importance this will have for her        development.  I have indicated a type of arrangement that it        would be possible to introduce without any consequences for        the care situation.         In conclusion, I would stress that one thing we know today is        that it is important for a child's development for him or her        to have stability, continuity and carers who take        responsibility for and are fond of it and help it affirm        itself as a person.  It is in the child's interest that the        carers should be confident that it is they who take decisions        about important events in the child's life.  This must be        taken into account if a right of access or visit is        established." II.     Relevant domestic law     A.  The 1953 Child Welfare Act        1. Compulsory care measures 30.     The public-care measures at issue in the present case werebased on provisions set out in the Child Welfare Act of 17 July 1953("the 1953 Act"), which was replaced by new legislation on1 January 1993 (see paragraphs 41-45 below). 31.     The principle underlying the 1953 Act, which was applicable inthis case, was that, generally speaking, it was in the best interestsof a child for it to be cared for by its natural parents.  If the childhad been taken into care, the best solution would in principle be forthe natural parents to remain in contact with it and retain parentalresponsibilities. 32.     Under section 16 (a) of the 1953 Act, protective measures couldbe taken if a child lived in such conditions that its physical andmental health was likely to be impaired or was seriously endangered.It was established case-law (see the Supreme Court's judgment of6 November 1986, Norsk Retstidende ("NRt") 1986, p. 1189, and judgmentof 21 January 1987, NRt 1987, p. 52) that such a measure could be takennot only where such harm had materialised but also where there was aclear risk of harm.  Consequently, under this provision, a child couldbe taken into care immediately after birth. 33.     Section 18 of the Act provided for several preventive measures(forebyggende tiltak), such as placing the child's home undersupervision, furnishing financial assistance, ensuring placement in akindergarten or a school, or providing care and treatment.         If such preventive measures were considered to be ineffectiveor had proved to be of no avail and leaving the child in its currentsituation pending care proceedings would entail a risk of harm tothe child, section 11 of the Act empowered the Health and Social Board(helse- og sosialstyret), hereinafter "the Board", or if necessary itschairperson, to take a child into care on a provisional basis.  Wheresuch an interim measure had been taken, the case had to be broughtbefore the Board, often represented by itsClient and Patient Committee.  Provided that the requirements ofsection 16 were fulfilled, the Board or the Committee could decide totake the child into public care (overta omsorgen) pursuant tosection 19 of the Act.  In practice the child was usually transferredto a suitable child care centre or a foster family. 34.     The 1953 Act did not contain any provision expressly empoweringthe authorities to restrict the parents' access to their child wherethe child had been taken into public care.  However, according to anauthoritative interpretation of section 19 by the Ministry of Justice,Department of Legislation (Justisdepartementets lovavdeling), the Boardor the Committee could also determine the extent of the parents' rightof access and whether or not the address of the foster family shouldbe kept secret (see the Department's statements of 28 October 1964 and14 March 1966). 35.     Where the Board or the Committee had decided to take a childinto care in accordance with the above rules they could also decide,pursuant to section 20 of the Act, to deprive the natural parents oftheir parental responsibilities.  Section 20 did not set out thecircumstances in which such a measure could be taken but, according tothe Supreme Court's case-law, it should be supported by weightyreasons.  A decision to deprive the natural parents of their parentalresponsibilities could not be taken unless the long-term consequencesof alternative arrangements were considered (see the Supreme Court'sjudgments of 20 December 1990, NRt 1990, p. 1274, and of 23 May 1991,NRt 1991, p. 557). Measures under section 20 were often taken with aview to adoption by the foster parents.  Adoption represented a finalbreak in the legal relations between the child and its natural parents.         The notion of parental responsibilities, which is defined inChapter 5 of the Child Act (Barnelova) no. 7 of 7 April 1981, comprisestwo elements: firstly a duty of care (omsut og omtanke), and secondlya duty and a right to decide, within certain limits, for the child inits personal matters (personlege tilhøve) (sections 30 to 33).  Thelatter include decisions on the child's place of residence, generaleducation, religious and civic education, medical and dental treatment,consent to marriage, adoption and employment (Lucy Smith andPeter Lødrup in Barn og Foreldre, 4th edition, Oslo 1993, pp. 67and 71).  In the present judgment the right of the parent to decide onthe child's personal matters is referred to as "parental rights". 36.     Compulsory care measures under the 1953 Act were to be liftedwhen the child was 21 years of age or when there were no longer anyreasons to maintain the measures (section 48).         2.  Administrative and judicial remedies against compulsory            care measures 37.     A decision by the Board or the Committee to take a child intocare, to deprive the parents of their parental responsibilities or torestrict access under the 1953 Act could be appealed against to theCounty Governor by any person affected by the measure (sections 52 and54 of the Act).  Orders on access could in addition be appealed againstto the Ministry of Child and Family Affairs (section 53 (2) of the1953 Act). 38.     Decisions by the County Governor under the 1953 Act regardingcare decisions and the deprivation of parental responsibilities, butnot access, could form the subject of an appeal to the City orDistrict Court under a special procedure provided for in Chapter 33 ofthe Code of Civil Procedure.  The court had jurisdiction to review allaspects of the case (Article 482).         An appeal against a judgment by the City or District Court laydirectly to the Supreme Court (Article 485).  This was to give priorityto the kind of cases to which Chapter 33 of the Code applied, as isillustrated by Article 478 of the Code which provided that theproceedings must be dealt with speedily. 39.     On the other hand, appeals to the courts against decisions bythe County Governor restricting access were governed by the ordinaryprocedure laid down in Chapter 30 of the Code of Civil Procedure andthe general principles of judicial review of administrative decisions.Such review covered not only questions of fact and of law but also tosome extent the exercise of administrative discretion (for a moredetailed description, see the E. v. Norway judgment of 29 August 1990,Series A no. 181-A, pp. 18-19, paras. 40-42). 40.     If an appeal by the natural parents to have the care terminatedhad been rejected, they were not entitled to apply for fresh reviewproceedings until one year after the prior decisions had become final(section 54 of the 1953 Act).  However, no such right to review appliedif the child had been adopted in the meantime, as adoption meant adefinite break between the child and its natural parents.     B.  The Child Welfare Services Act 1992 41.     On 1 January 1993 the 1953 Act was replaced by theChild Welfare Services Act no. 100 of 17 July 1992 ("the 1992 Act").Among other reforms the 1992 Act introduced a new adjudicating body inthe child welfare administration, namely the County Social WelfareBoard ("the County Board"), which was established in accordance withthe Social Services Act (sosialtjenesteloven) no. 81 of13 December 1991.  The major reason for this change was to reinforcethe legal protection of the parents and the child.         Like the 1953 Act, the 1992 Act stresses that "crucialimportance shall be attached to framing measures which are in thechild's best interest" (section 4-1). 42.     Although the 1992 Act contains more detailed provisions, theconditions for compulsory care measures and deprivation of parentalresponsibilities are essentially the same as those that applied underthe 1953 Act.  The Supreme Court's case-law predating the 1992 Actremains applicable. 43.     Under the 1992 Act the question of adoption of a child who hasbeen taken into care is a separate issue.  If the parents object toadoption, such a measure cannot be taken unless the County Board givesits consent.  Under the more detailed provisions of the 1992 Act(section 4-20 (2) and (3)), the County Board may only give its consentif the parents will be permanently unable to provide the child withreasonable care, or if removing the child may lead to serious problemsfor him or her because of his or her attachment to the persons and theenvironment where he or she is living.  In addition, an adoption mustbe in the child's best interest and the prospective adoptive parentsmust have been the child's foster parents and have shown themselves fitto bring up the child as their own.  According to the preparatory worksthis implies that consent to adoption should not be given unless thechild has lived in the foster home for some time. 44.     Unlike the 1953 Act, the 1992 Act contains in section 4-19 (1)a provision to the effect that both the child and the parent have aright of access unless the County Board decides otherwise in thechild's interests.  The preparatory works of the new Act emphasise theimportance of contact between the child and its parents. 45.     The decisions of the County Board may be contested before thecourts under the special provisions of Chapter 33 of theCode of Civil Procedure (section 9-10 of the Social Services Act).  Thesystem of judicial review of public-care decisions is amended ontwo major points.         Firstly, whereas judicial review of care decisions anddeprivation of parental responsibilities under the 1953 Act presupposeda prior decision by the County Governor, an appeal against suchdecisions taken by the County Board under the 1992 Act lies directlyto the City Court.         Secondly, whilst the special Chapter 33 review did not applyto access restrictions under the 1953 Act, it now does when suchrestrictions have been imposed under the 1992 Act (section 7-1). PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION 46.     In her application to the Commission of 10 October 1990(no. 17383/90), Ms Johansen complained that there had been a violationof her right to respect for family life as guaranteed by Article 8 ofthe Convention (art. 8) on account of the order to take her daughterinto public care, the deprivation of her parental rights, thetermination of her access to her daughter, the excessive length of theproceedings and their lack of fairness.  She also invoked Article 6 ofthe Convention (art. 6) (right to a fair hearing within a reasonabletime).  In addition, she complained that, contrary to Article 13(art. 13), she had not been afforded an effective remedy in respect ofher complaint under Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8). 47.     On 13 October 1993 the Commission declared the applicationadmissible.  In its report of 17 January 1995 (Article 31) (art. 31),the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been no violationof Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8) with regard to the taking ofher daughter into care and the maintenance in force of the caredecision concerned (unanimously); that there had been a violation ofArticle 8 (art. 8) as regards the decision depriving the applicant ofher parental rights and access (by eleven votes to two); that noseparate issue arose either under Article 6 (art. 6) (by twelve votesto one) or Article 13 (art. 13) (unanimously).  The full text of theCommission's opinion and of the two partly dissenting opinionscontained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment (1)._______________Note by the Registrar 1.  For practical reasons this annex will appear only with the printedversion of the judgment (in Reports of Judgments andDecisions 1996-III), but a copy of the Commission's report isobtainable from the registry._______________ FINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT 48.     At the hearing on 23 January 1996 the Government, as they haddone in their memorial, invited the Court to hold that there had beenno violation of Article 6 or 8 of the Convention (art. 6, art. 8). 49.     On the same occasion the applicant reiterated her request tothe Court stated in her memorial to find that there had been a breachof Articles 6 and 8 (art. 6, art. 8). AS TO THE LAW I.      ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 8) 50.     The applicant alleged that the taking into care of her daughterS., the refusal to terminate the care and the deprivation of herparental rights and access gave rise to violations of Article 8 of theConvention (art. 8), which provides:         "1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and        family life, his home and his correspondence.         2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with        the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance        with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the        interests of national security, public safety or the economic        well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or        crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the        protection of the rights and freedoms of others." 51.     The Government disputed the above contention.  The Commissionconsidered that there had been no violation with regard to the takinginto public care and the refusal to terminate the care, but that therehad been a violation with regard to the deprivation of the applicant'sparental rights and access.    A.   Was there an interference with the applicant's right to        respect for family life? 52.     The Court recalls that the mutual enjoyment by parent and childof each other's company constitutes a fundamental element of familylife and that domestic measures hindering such enjoyment amount to aninterference with the right protected by Article 8 (art. 8)(see, amongst others, the McMichael v. the United Kingdom judgment of24 February 1995, Series A no. 307-B, p. 55, para. 86).  The impugnedmeasures, as was not disputed, evidently amounted to interferences withthe applicant's right to respect for her family life as guaranteed byparagraph 1 of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8-1).  Suchinterference constitutes a violation of this Article (art. 8) unlessit is "in accordance with the law", pursues an aim or aims that arelegitimate under paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2) and can beregarded as "necessary in a democratic society".     B.  Were the interferences justified?         1. "In accordance with the law" 53.     It was undisputed before the Commission and, with oneexception, before the Court that the impugned measures had a basis innational law and, to that extent, the Court is satisfied that such wasthe case. 54.     The exception was an allegation by the applicant - in herwritten pleadings dealing with the necessity of the interference - tothe effect that the provisional taking into care of her daughter hadfailed to fulfil the condition as to risk of harm in section 11 of theChild Welfare Act 1953 (see paragraphs 12 and 33 above). 55.     The Government maintained that the measure was in accordancewith Norwegian law. 56.     The Court sees no reason to doubt that the provisional takinginto care of the daughter had a basis in Norwegian law; it observesthat the applicant, although she could have done so, did not appealagainst that measure but only challenged the subsequent decision totake into care on a permanent basis, which measure was upheld by theCity Court as being lawful. 57.     Before the Commission the applicant had argued that as therelevant law (see paragraphs 32-35 above) was framed in vague terms itseffects were unforeseeable and it thus failed to satisfy one of thequality requirements implied by the expression "in accordance with thelaw" (see, for instance, the Margareta and Roger Andersson v. Swedenjudgment of 25 February 1992, Series A no. 226-A, p. 25, para. 75). 58.     The Commission and the Government disagreed.  They consideredthat the law in question was rather broad in its terms but that it wasimpossible to formulate legal rules with absolute precision in thisfield.  Also, since the imposition of measures under that law was toa large extent subject to judicial review, there were importantsafeguards against arbitrariness. 59.     Before the Court the applicant did not pursue her submissionthat the relevant domestic law was not foreseeable for the purposes ofparagraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2).         2.  Legitimate aim 60.     Those who appeared before the Court agreed that the relevantdomestic law was clearly intended to protect the interests of childrenand that there was nothing to suggest that it was applied for any otherpurpose. 61.     The Court is satisfied that the contested measures were aimedat protecting the "health" and "rights and freedoms" of the applicant'sdaughter and thus pursued legitimate aims within the meaning ofparagraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2).         3. "Necessary in a democratic society" 62.     The applicant disputed that the interference with her right torespect for family life had been "necessary".  In this connection shechallenged a number of aspects of the domestic decisions, namely(1) the decision-making process before the Committee(see paragraphs 14-17 above); (2) the merits of the taking into careof her daughter S. and the maintenance in force of the care decision;(3) the merits of the deprivation of her parental rights and access;and (4) the length of the entire proceedings. 63.     The Government contested the applicant's allegations.  TheCommission disagreed on the first and second points but shared theapplicant's view as regards the third point, taking into account theargument concerning the length of the proceedings. 64.     In determining whether the impugned measures were "necessaryin a democratic society", the Court will consider whether, in the lightof the case as a whole, the reasons adduced to justify them wererelevant and sufficient for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 8(art. 8-2) (see, inter alia, the Olsson v. Sweden (no. 1) judgment of24 March 1988, Series A no. 130, p. 32, para. 68).         In so doing, the Court will have regard to the fact thatperceptions as to the appropriateness of intervention by publicauthorities in the care of children vary from one Contracting State toanother, depending on such factors as traditions relating to the roleof the family and to State intervention in family affairs and theavailability of resources for public measures in this particular area.However, consideration of what is in the best interest of the child isin any event of crucial importance.  Moreover, it must be borne in mindthat the national authorities have the benefit of direct contact withall the persons concerned (see the Olsson v. Sweden (no. 2) judgmentof 27 November 1992, Series A no. 250, pp. 35-36, para. 90), often atthe very stage when care measures are being envisaged or immediatelyafter their implementation.  It follows from these considerations thatthe Court's task is not to substitute itself for the domesticauthorities in the exercise of their responsibilities for theregulation of the public care of children and the rights of parentswhose children have been taken into care, but rather to review underthe Convention the decisions that those authorities have taken in theexercise of their power of appreciation (see, for instance, theHokkanen v. Finland judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 299-A,p. 20, para. 55).         The margin of appreciation so to be accorded to the competentnational authorities will vary in the light of the nature of the issuesand the seriousness of the interests at stake (see the Sunday Timesv. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series Ano. 30, pp. 35-37, para. 59).  Thus, the Court recognises that theauthorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in assessing thenecessity of taking a child into care.  However, a stricter scrutinyis called for both of any further limitations, such as restrictionsplaced by those authorities on parental rights and access, and of anylegal safeguards designed to secure an effective protection of theright of parents and children to respect for their family life.  Suchfurther limitations entail the danger that the family relations betweenthe parents and a young child are effectively curtailed.         It is against this background that the Court will examinewhether the measures constituting the interferences with theapplicant's exercise of her right to family life were "necessary".         (a) The decision-making process 65.     The applicant complained that the hearing before the Committeehad been inadequate.  Not only had the authorities beenover-represented, but their expert, Mr Rønbeck, had had a morefavourable position at the hearing than the psychologists whom theapplicant had wanted to be present: Mrs Valla had not been summoned andMr Larssen had not been allowed to address the Committee(see paragraph 17 above).  In addition, the fact that the hearing hadcontinued until late at night had adversely affected the applicant'spossibility of presenting her views in a fully satisfactory manner. 66.     The Court notes that the Committee took its decision of3 May 1990 after hearing the views of the applicant and her counsel.Mr Rønbeck had moreover been appointed with the applicant's agreementand it was only after he had presented his opinion that she requestedthe appointment of another psychologist, Mrs Valla.  Although thelatter was not heard directly by the Committee, her report wassubmitted to it (see paragraph 17 above).         In the circumstances, there is nothing to suggest that thedecision-making process leading to the adoption of the impugnedmeasures by the Committee was unfair or failed to involve the applicantto a degree sufficient to provide her with the requisite protection ofher interests (cf. the W. v. the United Kingdom judgment of8 July 1987, Series A no. 121, pp. 28-29, paras. 64-65; and theabove-mentioned McMichael judgment, pp. 55 and 57, paras. 87 and 92).In addition, it is to be noted that, before deciding the applicant'sappeals, the County Governor and the City Court heard the applicant andher counsel (see paragraphs 24 and 27 above).  The Court thereforeagrees with the Government and the Commission that the procedure didnot give rise to a breach of Article 8 (art. 8).         (b) The merits of the impugned measures         (i) The taking into care and the refusal to terminate the care 67.     As to the taking into care, the applicant maintained that theCommittee's majority had wrongly relied on Mr Rønbeck's assessment(see paragraphs 14 and 17 above).  In concluding that she was incapableof assuming the care of her daughter, he had over-emphasised theimportance of her difficult past in Bergen.  The minority had correctlybased its opinion on the assessment by the psychologist Mrs Valla, who,in the light of the improvements in the applicant's situation after shemoved to Oslo, had considered her suitable as a carer, as was confirmedby the subsequent opinions of two other psychologists, Mrs Seltzer andMrs Aanonsen (see paragraphs 18, 27 and 29 above).  Indeed, even theCity Court had found her suitable when adjudicating the case(see paragraph 27 above).         According to the applicant, any uncertainty as to her abilityto care for her daughter could have been reduced by resorting topreventive care measures.  For instance, the authorities could haveacceded to the applicant's request for a place in a mother-and-childunit, which would have enabled her to prove she was capable of assumingcare while under the supervision of the child welfare authorities.  Anylack of cooperation between her and the child welfare authorities inBergen had stemmed from her extremely difficult situation while livingthere and did not mean that she would not cooperate with theauthorities in Oslo; on the contrary she had declared her willingnessto do so. 68.     Also the County Governor, in rejecting the applicant's appealagainst the care decision, had in her view attached excessive weightto her past in Bergen and too little to the improvements in her abilityto provide care after her move to Oslo. 69.     She further maintained that the City Court's ruling had theundesirable consequence that a new-born baby placed in a foster homecould never be reunited with his or her natural parent even though thelatter, as here, was deemed capable of assuming care.  Since caremeasures were in principle to be temporary in character, theauthorities should instead have sought gradually to return the childto the applicant. 70.     The Government and the Commission were of the view that boththe taking into care and the maintenance in force of the care decisionwere "necessary" within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 8 of theConvention (art. 8-2). 71.     The Court observes that the Committee Chairperson's decisionof 13 December 1989 to take the applicant's daughter S. provisionallyinto care was taken on the grounds that the applicant, in view of herphysical and mental state at the time, was deemed unable to providesatisfactory care for her daughter, who would thus be at risk if shewere to remain with the applicant.  The Chairperson had regard not onlyto statements by medical officers in Oslo but also to those of thechild welfare authorities in Bergen, which, after several years'concern for the applicant's son C., had provisionally taken him intocare and had contemplated such a measure also with regard to thedaughter S. immediately after her birth (see paragraph 12 above).         Furthermore, in deciding to take S. into care on a permanentbasis, the Committee attached decisive weight to Mr Rønbeck'sassessment that the applicant suffered from serious unsolved mentalproblems impairing her social skills and her ability to take care ofchildren.  It considered that, if S. were to remain with the applicant,it was likely that the child would live under such conditions as woulddamage her physical and mental health.  Having failed to understand herson C.'s need for care, the applicant had opposed attempts by theauthorities to assist her in this matter.  The fact that preventivecare measures in respect of her son had been ineffective suggested thatthis kind of measure would also be unsuccessful with regard to herdaughter.  There was little reason to believe that the applicant wouldbe motivated to accept treatment.  The child was at a stage of herdevelopment where it was crucial that she should become attached tostable and secure persons without fearing that she would be moved.  Inthese circumstances, the Committee considered, it was in her bestinterests to be taken into care (see paragraphs 14 and 17 above).         Moreover, the County Governor's decision of 9 November 1990upholding the Committee's decision to take S. into care was basedessentially on the same reasons (see paragraph 24 above). 72.     In its decision of 16 April 1991 the City Court found that thematerial conditions (ytre betingelser) had improved to a point wherethe applicant was able to provide S. with a satisfactory upbringing butheld nevertheless that the measure should remain in force.  Itconsidered that, since S. had been taken into care shortly after birth,had had very little contact with her mother and had already been movedtwice, returning her to the mother would entail a particular risk toher development.  As the child was in the middle of a phase ofdevelopment of personal autonomy, it was crucial that she live undersecure and emotionally stable conditions, such as obtained in thefoster home.  Moreover, at this critical stage of her upbringing, therewas a real danger that the applicant would be unable to deal adequatelywith the child's reactions to the change of environment(see paragraph 27 above). 73.     In the light of the foregoing, the Court is satisfied that thetaking of the applicant's daughter S. into care and the maintenance inforce of the care decision concerned were based on reasons which werenot only relevant but also sufficient for the purposes of paragraph 2of Article 8 (art. 8-2).  The measures were supported by painstakingand detailed assessments by the experts appointed by the Committee andthe City Court.  The finding of fact being primarily a matter for thenational authorities, the Court will not substitute its views fortheirs as to the relative weight to be given to the expert evidenceadduced by each party (see paragraph 64 above).  It considers that intaking the above care measures the national authorities acted withinthe margin of appreciation afforded to them in such matters.Accordingly, these measures did not constitute a violation ofArticle 8 (art. 8).         (ii) The deprivation of parental rights and access 74.     In the applicant's and the Commission's opinion, taking intocare should in principle be a temporary measure to be discontinued assoon as circumstances permit.  The deprivation of the applicant'sparental rights and access had a permanent character and could only beconsidered "necessary" within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2(art. 8-2) if supported by particularly strong reasons.  However, theapplicant's state of health had not been such that she would have beenpermanently unable to care for her daughter.  The argument that theapplicant might disturb the calm and stable foster-home environmentcould not be decisive as access arrangements could have beenimplemented outside the foster home.  Having regard to the improvementsin the applicant's situation and the irreversible effects which thedeprivation of the applicant's parental rights and access had on herenjoyment of family life with her daughter, the measures could not besaid to be justified. 75.     In addition, the applicant disputed that the deprivation of herparental rights and access were in her daughter's interest.  On thecontrary, the mother's contact with her child during the periodpreceding her placement with the foster parents had been positive andsuch contact could have contributed to a stable development of thechild's identity had it been allowed to continue.  The applicantfurther stressed that the measures had not been based on proper andrepeated reviews of the specific circumstances of her case but on ageneral and prevailing view that adoption offered better prospects forthe child's welfare than long-term fostering.  Having been takenprimarily to facilitate adoption, the measures had seriously andpermanently prejudiced the applicant's interests by depriving her ofany prospects of being reunited with her daughter. 76.     The Government argued that in cases such as the present one thenecessity test to be applied under Article 8 of the Convention(art. 8), rather than attempting to strike a "fair balance" between theinterests of the natural parent and those of the child, should attachparamount importance to the best interests of the child, a principlewhich was firmly rooted not only in the laws of theCouncil of Europe member States but also in the Organisation's ownpolicies (see Council of Europe: Committee of MinistersResolution (77) 33 on placement of children, adopted on3 November 1977; 16th Conference of European Ministers of Justice,Lisbon, 21-22 June 1988, Conclusions and resolutions of the conference,pp. 5-6).  In this connection the Government referred also to thepreamble to the 1996 European Convention on the Exercise ofChildren's Rights and to Articles 3, 9 paras. 1 and 3, and 21 of the1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In anyevent, so the Government submitted, Article 8 of the Convention(art. 8) should not be interpreted so as to protect family life to thedetriment of the child's health and development. 77.     In the instant case, they maintained, the reasons mentionedabove for the taking into care and for maintaining the care decisionconcerned in force all suggested that it was necessary to place thechild permanently in a foster home.  There was strong scientificevidence indicating that the placement was more likely to be successfulif the child was adopted by the foster parents.         Reuniting the applicant with her daughter would have requiredextensive preparation presupposing good cooperation between all theparties involved.  However, the applicant had shown an extremelyhostile attitude towards the child welfare authorities in Bergen andhad actively obstructed their implementation of the care decision inrespect of her son by attempting to take him with her to Oslo.  Thecompetent authorities had therefore considered that there was a dangerthat she might disturb the daughter's development in the foster homeand try to abduct her if given access.  In these circumstances, havingregard to their margin of appreciation, the relevant authorities wereentitled to think that it was necessary for the protection of thechild's best interests to deprive the applicant of her parental rightsand access. 78.     The Court considers that taking a child into care shouldnormally be regarded as a temporary measure to be discontinued as soonas circumstances permit and that any measures of implementation oftemporary care should be consistent with the ultimate aim of reunitingthe natural parent and the child (see, in particular, theabove-mentioned Olsson (no. 1) judgment, p. 36, para. 81).  In thisregard, a fair balance has to be struck between the interests of thechild in remaining in public care and those of the parent in beingreunited with the child (see, for instance, the above-mentionedOlsson (no. 2) judgment, pp. 35-36, para. 90; and the above-mentionedHokkanen judgment, p. 20, para. 55).  In carrying out this balancingexercise, the Court will attach particular importance to the bestinterests of the child, which, depending on their nature andseriousness, may override those of the parent.  In particular, assuggested by the Government, the parent cannot be entitled underArticle 8 of the Convention (art. 8) to have such measures taken aswould harm the child's health and development.         In the present case the applicant had been deprived of herparental rights and access in the context of a permanent placement ofher daughter in a foster home with a view to adoption by thefoster parents (see paragraphs 17 and 22 above).  These measures wereparticularly far-reaching in that they totally deprived the applicantof her family life with the child and were inconsistent with the aimof reuniting them. Such measures should only be applied in exceptionalcircumstances and could only be justified if they were motivated by anoverriding requirement pertaining to the child's best interests(see, mutatis mutandis, the Margareta and Roger Andersson judgmentcited above, p. 31, para. 95). 79.     The question whether the deprivation of the applicant'sparental rights and access was justified must be assessed in the lightof the circumstances obtaining at the time when the decisions weretaken and not with the benefit of hindsight.  That question mustmoreover be considered in the light of the reasons mentioned inparagraphs 71 to 73 above for taking the daughter into care and formaintaining the care decision in force. 80.     It is also relevant that it was in the child's interest toensure that the process of establishing bonds with her foster parentswas not disrupted.  As already mentioned, the girl, who had been takeninto care shortly after birth and had already spent half a year withtemporary carers before being placed in a long-term foster home, wasat a stage of her development when it was crucial that she live undersecure and emotionally stable conditions.  The Court sees no reason todoubt that the care in the foster home had better prospects of successif the placement was made with a view to adoption (see paragraphs 17and 27 above).  Furthermore, regard must be had to the fact that thechild welfare authorities found that the applicant was not"particularly motivated to accept treatment" (see paragraph 17 above)and even feared that she might take her daughter away; for instance,she had on one occasion tried to disappear with her son and on anotheroccasion she had failed to inform the authorities that he had run awayfrom the children's home to join her (see paragraph 16 above). 81.     In the Court's opinion, the above considerations were allrelevant to the issue of necessity under paragraph 2 of Article 8(art. 8-2).  It remains to be examined whether they were alsosufficient to justify the Committee's decision of 3 May 1990 to cut offthe contact between the mother and the child (see paragraphs 17and 22 above). 82.     In the first place, it must be observed that during the periodbetween the birth of the applicant's daughter on 7 December 1989 andthe Committee's decision of 3 May 1990, the applicant had had accessto her child twice a week in a manner which does not appear to be opento criticism (see paragraph 16 above). 83.     Secondly, as indicated in the Committee's decision of3 May 1990, the applicant's lifestyle had by then already somewhatchanged for the better (see paragraph 17 above).         It was rather the difficulties experienced in theimplementation of the care decision concerning her son which providedthe reason for the authorities' view that the applicant was unlikelyto cooperate and that there was a risk of her disturbing the daughter'scare if given access to the foster home (see paragraphs 16and 17 above).         However, it cannot be said that those difficulties and thatrisk were of such a nature and degree as to dispense the authoritiesaltogether from their normal obligation under Article 8 of theConvention (art. 8) to take measures with a view to reuniting them ifthe mother were to become able to provide the daughter with asatisfactory upbringing. 84.     Against this background, the Court does not consider that thedecision of 3 May 1990, in so far as it deprived the applicant of heraccess and parental rights in respect of her daughter, was sufficientlyjustified for the purposes of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2), it nothaving been shown that the measure corresponded to any overridingrequirement in the child's best interests (see paragraph 78 above).         Therefore the Court reaches the conclusion that the nationalauthorities overstepped their margin of appreciation, thereby violatingthe applicant's rights under Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8).         In this connection it should be noted that less than a yearafter 3 May 1990 the City Court found that the applicant's materialconditions had improved to the point where she would have been able toprovide her daughter with a satisfactory upbringing.  An importantconsideration for the City Court in refusing to terminate care was thelack of contact between the applicant and her daughter pending theproceedings, which state of affairs resulted directly from the decisionof 3 May 1990 to deprive the applicant of her access (seeparagraph 27 above). 85.     In view of the reasons set out in paragraphs 82 to 84 above,the Court does not consider that the applicant's allegation that thelength of the care proceedings was excessive (see paragraph 62 above)gives rise to any issue under Article 8 (art. 8). II.     ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 1 OF THE CONVENTION        (art. 6-1) 86.     The applicant also complained about the length of theproceedings under Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1),which, in so far as relevant, reads:         "In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ...,        everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time        by [a] ... tribunal ..." 87.     The Government disagreed with the applicant, whereas theCommission, having taken the length of the proceedings into accountunder Article 8 (art. 8) (see paragraph 63 above), concluded that noseparate issue arose under Article 6 (art. 6). 88.     The Court observes that the proceedings leading to thedeprivation of parental rights and access commenced before theCommittee on 13 December 1989 and ended when the Supreme Court refusedleave to appeal on 19 September 1991 (see paragraphs 12 and 28 above).They thus lasted altogether one year and nine months.         The Court shares the applicant's and the Commission's opinionthat, in view of what was at stake for the applicant and theirreversible and definitive character of the measures concerned, thecompetent national authorities were required by Article 6 para. 1(art. 6-1) to act with exceptional diligence in ensuring the progressof the proceedings.  However, it does not find that they failed todischarge their obligations in this respect.         In the Court's opinion the issues to be determined by therelevant administrative and judicial authorities were of a certaincomplexity.  The proceedings comprised a thorough examination of themerits of the impugned care measures by the Committee's Chairperson,the Committee itself, the County Governor and the City Court and thena summary examination by the Supreme Court which refused leave toappeal (see paragraphs 12, 17, 24, 27 and 28 above).  Thusthree administrative and two judicial levels were involved and thereis nothing to suggest, as was also conceded by the Commission, that anyof these separately failed to act with the diligence required in theparticular circumstances.  Nor does it appear, having regard to thecomplexity of the case, that the duration of the proceedings as a wholeexceeded a reasonable time. 89.     Accordingly, the Court finds no breach of Article 6 of theConvention (art. 6) on account of the length of the proceedings. III.    ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 13) 90.     Before the Commission the applicant alleged that there had beena breach of Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13), which reads:         "Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the]        Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before        a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has        been committed by persons acting in an official capacity." 91.     This complaint, which in the Commission's opinion gave rise tono issue separate from that under Article 8 (art. 8), was not pursuedby the applicant before the Court, which does not consider it necessaryto examine it of its own motion. IV.     APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 50) 92.     Ms Adele Johansen sought just satisfaction under Article 50 ofthe Convention (art. 50), which reads:         "If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a        legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting        Party is completely or partially in conflict with the        obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the        internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation        to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure,        the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just        satisfaction to the injured party." 93.     The applicant sought no compensation for damage but claimed thereimbursement of costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings beforethe Court.  By letter of 17 June 1996, she stated that she waived herArticle 50 (art. 50) claim, the costs and expenses in question havingbeen reimbursed by way of legal aid from the Norwegian authorities. FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT 1.      Holds unanimously that the taking into care of the applicant's        daughter and the maintenance in force of the relevant care        decision did not give rise to a breach of Article 8 of the        Convention (art. 8); 2.      Holds by eight votes to one that the decision of 3 May 1990,        in so far as it deprived the applicant of her access and        parental rights in respect of her daughter, constituted a        violation of Article 8 (art. 8); 3.      Holds unanimously that there has been no violation of        Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1); 4.      Holds unanimously that it is not necessary to examine whether        there was a breach of Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13); 5.      Holds unanimously that it is not necessary to make an award        for costs and expenses.         Done in English and in French, and delivered at a publichearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 7 August 1996. Signed: Rudolf BERNHARDT        President Signed: Herbert PETZOLD        Registrar         In accordance with Article 51 para. 2 of the Convention(art. 51-2) and Rule 55 para. 2 of Rules of Court B, the partlydissenting opinion of Mr Morenilla is annexed to this judgment. Initialled: R.B. Initialled: H.P.              PARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE MORENILLA 1.      I agree with the majority that the taking into care of theapplicant's daughter and the maintenance in force of the care decisionwere "necessary in a democratic society" within the meaning ofparagraph 2 of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8-2).  However, unlikethe majority, I find that the Norwegian administrative and judicialauthorities were entitled to think that it was "necessary" also todeprive the applicant of her parental rights and access in respect ofthe daughter. 2.      When judging the necessity of these measures, the Court should,as rightly pointed out by the majority (see paragraph 64 of thejudgment), examine whether the reasons adduced by the domesticauthorities were "relevant and sufficient" in the light of the case asa whole.  Moreover, regard should be had to the margin of appreciationto be accorded to them in this area, which, in addition to thosereasons mentioned in paragraph 64 of the judgment, may be justified bythe changing structure of family life in many member States of theCouncil of Europe (see Gomien, Harris and Zwaak, Law and Practice ofthe European Convention on Human Rights and the European SocialCharter, Strasbourg 1996, pp. 242, 243).         I share the majority's view that the authorities' discretionin assessing the necessity of taking a child into care should be a wideone but, unlike the majority, I see no valid justification for theCourt to exercise a stricter scrutiny of restrictions on parentalrights and access.  In my view, in respect of the latter kind ofmeasure too, the Court should avoid playing the role of a court ofappeal and should limit itself to reviewing whether the applicant'sinterests were duly protected in the decision-making process andwhether the justifications adduced by the national authorities couldreasonably be made on the basis of the facts established by them. 3.      In the instant case, the decision-making process leading to thedecisions depriving the applicant of her parental rights and accesswas, as also observed by the majority, beyond reproach.         However, unlike the majority, I consider that the difficultieswhich the child welfare authorities experienced with the applicant andthe risk of her disturbing the foster-home environment were such as toexempt them from their normal duty under Article 8 (art. 8) to takemeasures with a view to reuniting her and the daughter.  In seriouscircumstances such as those which obtained in the instant case, wherethe life, health and development of the child were at risk, societymust be able to intervene by taking such measures as are required inorder to protect the best interests of the child, even though it mayhave the ultimate effect of disrupting in an irreversible manner thenatural bonds between the mother and the daughter.  Such interests wereparamount not only under the relevant domestic law(see paragraphs 30-40 of the judgment) but also under Article 8 of theConvention (art. 8) (see, for instance, the Keegan v. Ireland judgmentof 26 May 1994, Series A no. 290, pp. 20-21, para. 55; and the Olssonv. Sweden (no. 2) judgment of 27 November 1992, Series A no. 250,pp. 35-36, para. 90), which should be interpreted in the light ofResolution (77) 33 on placement of children adopted by the Committeeof Ministers of the Council of Europe on 3 November 1977.         Although I am aware of the serious consequences of the measuresfor the applicant's family life, I consider that in the circumstancesthe authorities were, having regard to their margin of appreciation,entitled to think that it was necessary to deprive the applicant of herparental rights and access in the context of a permanent placement ofthe child in a foster home with a view to adoption.  In my opinion, inreaching the contrary conclusion, the majority has based itself onreasoning (see paragraphs 82-84 of the judgment) which amounts to areassessment of the evidence established by the Committee(see paragraph 17) and the County Governor (see paragraph 22). 4.      For these reasons, I cannot follow the majority in finding thatthe national authorities, by depriving the applicant of her parentalrights and access, "overstepped their margin of appreciation, therebyviolating the applicant's rights under Article 8 of the Convention(art. 8)".
