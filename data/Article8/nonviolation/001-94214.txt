The case originated in an application (no. 16682/90) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by twenty-six Cypriot nationals and three registered companies (“the applicants”), on 26 January 1990.2.
The applicants were represented by Mr P. Clerides, a lawyer practising in Nicosia. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Z.M. Necatigil.3.
The applicants alleged, in particular, that the Turkish occupation of the northern part of Cyprus had deprived them of their homes and properties.4.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).5.
By a decision of 18 May 1999 the Court declared the application partly admissible.6.
The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). In addition, third-party comments were received from the Government of Cyprus, which had exercised its right to intervene (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 1 (b)).THE FACTSA.
The application and the general background7.
The application was initially lodged in the name of the “Pancyprian Association of Affected and Displaced Persons”, an “association representing all affected and displaced persons as a result of the Turkish occupation of Cyprus”. By letters of 19 February and 2 March 1990, the Secretariat of the Commission requested the applicants' representative to clarify whether the application was to be regarded as having been lodged by each of the individual members of the association, or by the association itself as a non-governmental organisation. In a letter of 30 March 1990 the applicants' representative indicated that “the application [was] to be regarded as introduced by each of the individual members”, a list of which was provided.8.
The 26 individual applicants are Cypriot nationals whose names are indicated in the list attached to the present judgment; they alleged that they had been permanent residents of the District of Famagusta, in the northern part of Cyprus. The 3 remaining applicants (nos. 5, 13 and 27 in the attached list) are private companies registered under Cypriot law.9.
In July 1974, as the Turkish troops were advancing, the individual applicants fled to the southern part of Cyprus. All the applicants alleged that they had been the owners of substantial properties in the District of Famagusta (see details below).10.
They alleged that the Turkish military authorities had occupied their homes and properties and had prevented them from having access to and using them.11.
By letters of 25 September 1999, the applicants' representative requested the Court to discontinue the proceedings before it with regard to applicants nos. 18 to 28.B.

PRELIMINARY ISSUE46.
The Court notes at the outset that the applicant no. 9 died on an unspecified date after his application was lodged, while the case was still pending before the Court. The administrator of his estate (Mrs Melita Theodoridou) informed the Court that she wished to pursue the application (see paragraph 31 above). Although the heirs of a deceased applicant cannot claim a general right to the continued examination of the deceased's application (see Scherer v. Switzerland, 25 March 1994, Series A no. 287), the Court has accepted on a number of occasions that close relatives of a deceased applicant are entitled to take his or her place (see Deweer v. Belgium, 27 February 1980, § 37, Series A no. 35, and Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, § 2, Series A no. 281-A).47.
For the purposes of the instant case, the Court is prepared to accept that the administrator of applicant no. 9's estate can pursue the application initially brought by Mr Kostas Kalisperas (see, mutatis mutandis, Kirilova and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 42908/98, 44038/98, 44816/98 and 7319/02, § 85, 9 June 2005, and Nerva and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 42295/98, § 33, ECHR 2002‑VIII).48.
The Court further notes that applicant no. 15 died on 21 April 1976, before the application was lodged (see paragraph 42 above). Under these conditions, the Court is unable to accept, as such, the applicants' representative's request for the examination of the application to be “continue[d] on behalf of the estate”. However, for the purposes of the present proceedings, it can be assumed that, since the date it was lodged, the application has implicitly been lodged in the name of Mr Takis N. Georgiades's estate and that its administrators, Mr Andreas Matsis and Aristotelis Galatopoulos, have locus standi before the Court to represent the estate's interests.II.
WITHDRAWAL OF THE APPLICATION49.
The Court observes that applicants nos. 18 to 28 declared, through their lawyer, that they wished to withdraw their application (see paragraph 11 above). The Court considers that, in these circumstances, applicants nos. 18 to 28 may be regarded as no longer wishing to pursue their application, within the meaning of Article 37 § 1 (a) of the Convention.50.
The Court further observes that applicant no. 29 has lodged a separate application (no. 16161/90), in which he complained about the same facts in relation to the same immovable properties in northern Cyprus. Application no. 16161/90 was declared admissible on 24 August 1999 and a judgment finding a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was delivered on 20 January 2009. The Court is of the opinion that applicant no. 29's complaints have been addressed within the ambit of application no. 16161/90. It therefore considers that it is no longer justified to continue the examination of the complaints introduced by applicant no. 29, within the meaning of Article 37 § 1 (c) of the Convention.51.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 37 § 1 in fine, the Court finds no special circumstances regarding respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols which require the continued examination of the case with regard to the above-mentioned applicants.52.
In view of the above, it is appropriate to strike the application out of the list of cases as far as applicants nos. 18 to 29 are concerned.53.
The Court will accordingly examine only the complaints lodged by applicants nos. 1 to 17 (hereinafter referred to as “the applicants”).III.
THE GOVERNMENT'S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS1.
Objection of inadmissibility ratione personae54.
The Government observed, firstly, that the application had been brought on behalf of a “Pancyprian association representing numerous affected and displaced persons”. They noted, however, that no document certifying that this association was duly registered with corporate status under the laws of Cyprus had been submitted and no list of its members and/or of its board of directors had been produced. The form of authority in favour of the applicants' lawyer bore only two signatures and the names of the signatories were not given in printed form.55.
The Government considered that the “Pancyprian association” had not been directly affected by the facts complained of and therefore could not claim to be a victim of any alleged violation.56.
In its decision on the admissibility of the application, the Court noted:“The respondent Government have not provided any observations on the admissibility of the case, although they have been given ample opportunity to do so. It must, therefore, be assumed that they do not contest the admissibility of the application.”57.
The Court does not see any reason to depart from this finding. Accordingly, the Government may be considered in principle estopped from raising their objections to admissibility at this stage (Rule 55 of the Rules of Court; see, inter alia, Amrollahi v. Denmark, no. 56811/00, § 22, 11 July 2002, and Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, § 44, ECHR 1999-II).58.
In any event, and in so far as certain of the respondent Government's objections could be considered to have been raised at the admissibility stage by implication, the Court observes that, following a request from the Commission Secretariat, on 30 March 1990 the applicants' representative indicated that “the application [was] to be regarded as introduced by each of the individual members” of the “Pancyprian Association of Affected and Displaced Persons” (see paragraph 7 above).59.
It follows that the Government's preliminary objection of inadmissibility ratione personae must be dismissed.2.
Other objections of inadmissibility60.
The Government also raised preliminary objections of inadmissibility ratione loci and ratione temporis, non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status. The Court observes that these objections are identical to those raised in the case of Alexandrou v. Turkey (no. 16162/90, §§ 11-22, 20 January 2009), and should be dismissed for the same reasons.IV.
ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 TO THE CONVENTION61.
The applicants complained that since 1974, Turkey had prevented them from exercising their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions.They invoked Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which reads:“Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.”62.
The Government disputed this claim.A.
The arguments of the parties1.
The Government63.
The Government observed that only applicants nos. 15 and 17 had indicated that their place of residence was in Famagusta. The other applicants had their residences elsewhere. In any event, the Turkish military forces had not been stationed in Famagusta since 1974 and not all applicants were “owners of properties in Famagusta”, as shown by the fact that 568 out of the original 596 applicants had been unable to substantiate their property claims and consequently had had to withdraw their applications. The applicants had not fled to southern Cyprus, but had voluntarily moved there of their own will.64.
The Government further observed that applicants nos. 4, 14 and 17 had failed to substantiate their claims by producing title deeds. As for the applicants who had produced affirmations of ownership issued by the Greek-Cypriot Land Office, the Government argued that these documents should not be accepted as a valid title to property, as they had been issued purely on the basis of a declaration by the applicants themselves. Furthermore, the names of the applicants in the application form and in the affirmation of ownership were not always identical.65.
Where the applicants had died after 1974 (as allegedly had happened in the cases of applicants nos. 15 and 16) the application could not be continued in the name of their heirs, as death had broken the chain of causation. The companies were entitled to complain only in respect of properties registered in their names and not in respect of real estate belonging to any other person.66.
The Turkish military authorities had not occupied the applicants' homes and properties. These had been expropriated under Article 159 of the Constitution of the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (the “TRNC”), a provision which for the purposes of the Convention should be regarded as a valid legal basis for the expropriation of the applicant's properties. The question of compensation for the loss of property or of the return of misplaced persons to their former residences could not be settled by individual applications to the Court, but should be discussed and solved at the political level. In the current situation of the island, it would be unrealistic to recognise a right to access to property for individual applicants in isolation from the political situation. In any event, any interference with the applicants' property rights had been aimed at rehousing Turkish-Cypriot refugees and had therefore been justified in the general interest.2.
The applicants67.
The applicants alleged that they had produced all the necessary evidence. In some instances, their title to the properties had been entered in the relevant District Lands Office Registry prior to the Turkish invasion; in others, their claim to ownership had been evidenced by purchase agreements. The applicants had been forced to flee northern Cyprus and in most cases had been unable to take with them the certificates of registration or title deeds or other important documents. Since 1974 the records of the District Lands Registry in northern Cyprus had been in the hands of the respondent Government and the applicants could not gain access to them.68.
Those applicants who had kept copies of the pre-occupation title documents had produced them. Those who did not have such copies had obtained “affirmations of ownership of Turkish-occupied immovable property” from the Republic of Cyprus on the basis of the reconstructed land register for the District of Famagusta.69.
The applicants alleged that the interference with their property rights had not served any legitimate aim, had not had a valid legal basis and had in any event not been proportionate to the purported aim of finding housing for Turkish-Cypriots. Most of their properties had not been used for that purpose, as the “Varosha” area of Famagusta had become a military “ghost town” with no civilian population at all. B.
The third-party intervener's arguments70.
The Government of Cyprus observed that its department of Lands and Surveys had provided with certificates of affirmation of ownership owners who did not have title deeds in their possession but whose title had been entered in District Land Office registers in the Turkish-occupied area. These certificates were prima facie evidence of their right of property. The “TRNC” authorities were in possession of all the records of the Department of Lands and Surveys relating to the title to properties. It was therefore the duty of the respondent Government to produce them.71.
The third-party intervener further noted that the present case was similar to that of Loizidou v. Turkey (((merits), 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI), where the Court had found that the loss of control of property by displaced persons had arisen as a consequence of the occupation of the northern part of Cyprus by Turkish troops and the establishment of the “TRNC” and that the denial of access to property in occupied northern Cyprus constituted a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.C.
The Court's assessment72.
The Court first notes that the documents submitted by the applicants (see paragraphs 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 40, 42, 44 and 45 above) provide prima facie evidence that they had a title to the properties at issue. As the respondent Government have failed to produce convincing evidence to rebut this, the Court considers that these properties were “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It also observes that applicant no. 16 has produced written proof that his father had died before the Turkish invasion and that he had been appointed administrator of his estate (see paragraph 44 above). As far as applicant no. 12 is concerned, it is noted that he was the owner of some of the properties (notably, those described in paragraph 36 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) above) only until 28 July 1998, when they were transferred to his wife and daughters (see paragraph 37 above).73.
The Court observes that in the aforementioned Loizidou case ((merits), cited above, §§ 63-64), it reasoned as follows:“63.
... as a consequence of the fact that the applicant has been refused access to the land since 1974, she has effectively lost all control over, as well as all possibilities to use and enjoy, her property. The continuous denial of access must therefore be regarded as an interference with her rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Such an interference cannot, in the exceptional circumstances of the present case to which the applicant and the Cypriot Government have referred, be regarded as either a deprivation of property or a control of use within the meaning of the first and second paragraphs of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. However, it clearly falls within the meaning of the first sentence of that provision as an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. In this respect the Court observes that hindrance can amount to a violation of the Convention just like a legal impediment.64.
Apart from a passing reference to the doctrine of necessity as a justification for the acts of the 'TRNC' and to the fact that property rights were the subject of intercommunal talks, the Turkish Government have not sought to make submissions justifying the above interference with the applicant's property rights which is imputable to Turkey.It has not, however, been explained how the need to rehouse displaced Turkish Cypriot refugees in the years following the Turkish intervention in the island in 1974 could justify the complete negation of the applicant's property rights in the form of a total and continuous denial of access and a purported expropriation without compensation.Nor can the fact that property rights were the subject of intercommunal talks involving both communities in Cyprus provide a justification for this situation under the Convention. In such circumstances, the Court concludes that there has been and continues to be a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.”74.
In the case of Cyprus v. Turkey (no. 25781/94, ECHR 2001-IV) the Court confirmed the above conclusions (§§ 187 and 189):“187.
The Court is persuaded that both its reasoning and its conclusion in the Loizidou judgment (merits) apply with equal force to displaced Greek Cypriots who, like Mrs Loizidou, are unable to have access to their property in northern Cyprus by reason of the restrictions placed by the 'TRNC' authorities on their physical access to that property. The continuing and total denial of access to their property is a clear interference with the right of the displaced Greek Cypriots to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1....189.
.. there has been a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 by virtue of the fact that Greek-Cypriot owners of property in northern Cyprus are being denied access to and control, use and enjoyment of their property as well as any compensation for the interference with their property rights.”75.
The Court sees no reason in the instant case to depart from the conclusions which it reached in the Loizidou and Cyprus v. Turkey cases (op. cit.; see also Demades v. Turkey (merits), no. 16219/90, § 46, 31 July 2003).76.
Accordingly, it concludes that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention by virtue of the fact that the applicants were denied access to and the control, use and enjoyment of their properties as well as any compensation for the interference with their property rights.V.
ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION77.
The applicants submitted that, as they had been unable to return to northern Cyprus, they were the victims of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.This provision reads as follows:“1.
Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.2.
There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”78.
The Government disputed this claim, observing that the inability of individual applicants to gain access to their homes was the inevitable consequence of the political state of affairs on the island. No question under Article 8 could arise in respect of the applicant companies.79.
Some of the applicants submitted that, contrary to the applicant in the Loizidou case, they had had their home and businesses in northern Cyprus. They claimed that any interference with their Article 8 rights had not been justified under the second paragraph of this provision.80.
The Government of Cyprus submitted that where the applicants' properties constituted the person concerned's home, there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.81.
The Court first notes that applicants nos. 5, 6, 11 and 13 have not clearly indicated their place of residence in northern Cyprus at the time of the Turkish invasion. They have therefore failed to substantiate their Article 8 complaint. It also notes that in the case of applicant no. 15, the application should be considered as having been brought in the name of the estate of Mr Takis N. Georgiades (see paragraph 48 above) and observes that it has not been established that the deceased and/or the administrators of his estate were residing in the District of Famagusta.82.
It follows that no violation of Article 8 of the Convention can be found in respect of applicants nos. 5, 6, 11, 13 and 15.83.
As regards applicant no. 14, the Court observes that he was not the owner of the house where he was allegedly living at the time of the Turkish invasion (see paragraph 40 above). Under these circumstances, the Court is not convinced that a separate issue may arise under Article 8 of the Convention. It therefore considers that it is not necessary to examine whether there has been a continuing violation of this provision in respect of applicant no. 14.84.
As to the remaining applicants, the Court notes that the Government failed to produce any evidence capable of casting doubt upon their statements that, at the time of the Turkish invasion, they were regularly residing in northern Cyprus in houses belonging to them or their close relatives that were treated by them and their families as homes (see paragraphs 14, 16, 18, 20, 26, 29, 31, 33, 37, 44 and 45 above).85.
Accordingly, the Court considers that in the circumstances of the present case, the houses of applicants nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16 and 17 qualified as “homes” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention at the time when the acts complained of took place.86.
The Court observes that the present case differs from the Loizidou case ((merits), cited above) since, unlike Mrs Loizidou, applicants nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16 and 17 actually had a home in northern Cyprus.87.
The Court notes that since 1974 these applicants have been unable to gain access to and to use their homes. In this connection, it points out that, in its judgment in the case of Cyprus v. Turkey (cited above, §§ 172-175), it concluded that the complete denial of the right of Greek‑Cypriot displaced persons to respect for their homes in northern Cyprus since 1974 constituted a continuing violation of Article 8 of the Convention. The Court reasoned as follows:“172.
The Court observes that the official policy of the 'TRNC' authorities to deny the right of the displaced persons to return to their homes is reinforced by the very tight restrictions operated by the same authorities on visits to the north by Greek Cypriots living in the south. Accordingly, not only are displaced persons unable to apply to the authorities to reoccupy the homes which they left behind, they are physically prevented from even visiting them.173.
The Court further notes that the situation impugned by the applicant Government has obtained since the events of 1974 in northern Cyprus. It would appear that it has never been reflected in 'legislation' and is enforced as a matter of policy in furtherance of a bi-zonal arrangement designed, it is claimed, to minimise the risk of conflict which the intermingling of the Greek and Turkish-Cypriot communities in the north might engender. That bi-zonal arrangement is being pursued within the framework of the inter-communal talks sponsored by the United Nations Secretary-General ...174.
The Court would make the following observations in this connection: firstly, the complete denial of the right of displaced persons to respect for their homes has no basis in law within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention (see paragraph 173 above); secondly, the inter-communal talks cannot be invoked in order to legitimate a violation of the Convention; thirdly, the violation at issue has endured as a matter of policy since 1974 and must be considered continuing.175.
In view of these considerations, the Court concludes that there has been a continuing violation of Article 8 of the Convention by reason of the refusal to allow the return of any Greek-Cypriot displaced persons to their homes in northern Cyprus.”88.
The Court sees no reason in the instant case to depart from the above reasoning and findings (see also Demades (merits), cited above, §§ 36-37).89.
Accordingly, it concludes that there has been a continuing violation of Article 8 of the Convention on account of the complete denial of the right of applicants nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16 and 17 to respect for their homes.VI.
ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF THE CONVENTION AND OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION, READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION AND ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 190.
The applicants complained of a violation of the general obligation to respect human rights enshrined in Article 1 of the Convention. They also complained of a violation under Article 14 of the Convention on account of discriminatory treatment against them in the enjoyment of their rights under Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. They alleged that this discrimination was based on their national origin and religious beliefs.The relevant provisions read as follows:Article 1 of the Convention“The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of [the] Convention.”Article 14 of the Convention“The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.”91.
The Government disputed these claims.92.
The Court recalls that in the Alexandrou case (cited above, §§ 38-39) it has found that it was not necessary to carry out a separate examination of the complaint under Article 14 of the Convention. The Court does not see any reason to depart from that approach in the present case (see also, mutatis mutandis, Eugenia Michaelidou Ltd and Michael Tymvios v. Turkey, no. 16163/90, §§ 37-38, 31 July 2003). Moreover, the Court has found the respondent Government to be in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and of Article 8 of the Convention and does not consider it necessary to examine the complaint under Article 1, which is a framework provision that cannot be breached on its own (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, § 238, 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, and Eugenia Michaelidou Ltd and Michael Tymvios, cited above, § 42).VII.
APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION93.
Article 41 of the Convention provides:“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”A.
Pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage1.
The parties' submissions(a)
The applicants94.
In their just satisfaction claims of September 1999, the applicants requested an award in respect of pecuniary damage. They relied on experts' reports assessing the value of their losses which included the loss of annual rent collected or expected to be collected from renting out their properties, plus interest from the date on which such rents were due until the date of payment. The rent claimed was for the period dating back to January 1987, when the respondent Government accepted the right of individual petition, until 1999. The applicants did not claim compensation for any purported expropriation since they were still the legal owners of the properties.95.
The starting point of the valuation reports was the rental value of the applicants' properties in 1974, calculated on the basis of a percentage of their market value or assessed by comparing the rental value of similar land at the relevant time. This sum was subsequently adjusted upwards by applying an average annual rental increase varying between 5% and 12%. Compound interest for delayed payment was applied at a rate of 8% per annum.96.

In a letter of 28 January 2008 the applicants observed that a long period had passed since their first claims for just satisfaction and that the claim for pecuniary loss needed to be updated according to data concerning the increase in market value of the land in Cyprus. The average increase in this respect was 10% to 15% per annum.114.
In their just satisfaction claims of September 1999, all the applicants further claimed CYP 40,000 (approximately EUR 68,344) each in respect of non-pecuniary damage. They stated that this sum had been calculated on the basis of the sum awarded by the Court in the Loizidou case ((just satisfaction), cited above) while taking into account the fact that the period in respect of which the claim was made in the instant case was longer. With the exception of applicants nos. 5, 6, 11 and 13, they also claimed the additional sum of CYP 70,000 (approximately EUR 119,602) each with respect for the moral damage suffered for the loss of their homes.(b)
The Government115.
The Government filed comments on the applicants' claims for just satisfaction on 15 September 2008. They pointed out that almost all the applicants had produced old certificates or title deeds or otherwise not fully reliable evidence of ownership and maintained that the claims for just satisfaction were not ready for examination. For instance, a sale contract could not prove that the property allegedly purchased had been effectively transferred to the buyer. Moreover, some of the properties allegedly owned by applicants nos. 9 and 15 in fact belonged to a religious trust known as Vakf. Once it had acquired ownership, its real estate could not be transferred to individuals. The Government submitted that the issues relating to respect of the principles applicable to this kind of property should be left to the domestic courts and that the European Court of Human Rights should not deliver judgments which might prejudice the rights of the Cyprus Evcaf Administration (which had competence over Vakf properties) and those of the beneficiaries. Applicant no. 16 was only the co-administrator of his father's estate and could therefore not claim to be a victim of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.116.
Owing to the lapse of time since the lodging of the application, new situations might have arisen (for instance, applicant no. 12's properties had been transferred to his heirs in 1998); these facts could be certified only by the Greek-Cypriot authorities, who, since 1974, had reconstructed the registers and records of all properties in northern Cyprus and had, since 1968, been in possession of the Lands Records Registers relating to the Morphou region and to some areas of Nicosia. Applicants should be required to provide search certificates issued by the Department of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus. Moreover, in cases where the original applicant had passed away or the property had changed hands, questions might arise as to whether the new owners had a legal interest in the property and whether they were entitled to pecuniary and/or non-pecuniary damages.117.
The Government further noted that some applicants had shared properties and that it was not proven that their co-owners had agreed to the partition of the possessions. Nor, when claiming damages based on the assumption that the properties had been rented after 1974, had the applicants shown that the rights of the said co-owners under domestic law had been respected.2.
The third party intervener118.
The Government of Cyprus fully supported the applicants' claims for just satisfaction.3.
The Court's assessment119.
The Court first notes that the Government's submission that doubts might arise as to the applicants' title of ownership over the properties at issue (see paragraphs 115-116 above) is, in substance, an objection of incompatibility ratione materiae with the provisions of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Such an objection should have been raised before the application was declared admissible or, at the latest, in the context of the parties' observations on the merits. In any event, the Court cannot but confirm its finding that the properties described in the present application constituted the applicants' “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraph 72 above).120.
In the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the question of the application of Article 41 in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage is not ready for decision. It observes, in particular, that the parties have failed to provide reliable and objective data pertaining to the prices of land and real estate in Cyprus at the date of the Turkish intervention. This failure renders it difficult for the Court to assess whether the estimate furnished by the applicants of the 1974 market value of their properties is reasonable. The question must accordingly be reserved and the subsequent procedure fixed with due regard to any agreement which might be reached between the respondent Government and the applicants (Rule 75 § 1 of the Rules of Court).B.
Costs and expenses121.
In their just satisfaction claims of September 1999, applicants nos. 1 to 8 and 10 to 17 sought CYP 2,280 (approximately EUR 3,895) each for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court. This sum included the costs of the experts' reports assessing the value of their properties. Applicant no. 9 sought CYP 3,560 (approximately EUR 6,082) under this head.122.
The Government did not comment on this point.123.
In the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the question of the application of Article 41 in respect of costs and expenses is not ready for decision. The question must accordingly be reserved and the subsequent procedure fixed with due regard to any agreement which might be reached between the respondent Government and the applicants.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT1.

Antonakis Solomonides DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE KARAKAŞUnlike the majority, I consider that the objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies raised by the Government should not have been rejected. Consequently, I cannot agree with the finding of violations of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 8 of the Convention, for the same reasons as those mentioned in my dissenting opinion in the case of Gavriel v. Turkey (no. 41355/98, 20 January 2009).
