Russia,The European Court of Human Rights (First Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre, President,Elisabeth Steiner,Khanlar Hajiyev,Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos,Erik Møse,Ksenija Turković,Dmitry Dedov, judges,and Søren Nielsen, Section Registrar,Having deliberated in private on 26 August 2014,Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date:PROCEDURE1.
The case originated in twelve applications (see details in Appendix I) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Russian nationals (“the applicants”), on the dates indicated in Appendix I below.2.
The applicants were represented before the Court by Mr D. Itslayev and Mr T. Shamsudinov, lawyers practising in Grozny, lawyers from the NGO Stichting Russian Justice Initiative (SRJI) (in partnership with the NGO Astreya), and lawyers from the NGO Materi Chechni. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.3.
The applicants alleged that on various dates between 2001 and 2006 their sixteen relatives had been abducted by State servicemen in Chechnya and that no effective investigation of the matter had taken place.4.
On 17 January 2012 the applications were communicated to the Government.THE FACTSI.
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE5.
The applicants are Russian nationals who live in various districts of the Chechen Republic. They are the close relatives of people who disappeared after allegedly being arrested at their homes by servicemen. In each of the applications, the events took place in areas under the full control of the Russian federal forces. The alleged abductions were primarily carried out during curfew hours, at night or early in the morning. In some of the cases, the applicants submitted that, at the material time, a special operation was being conducted by military servicemen or law-enforcement agencies in the area, which was subsequently confirmed by the investigation (see, for example, Vezirov and Others (no. 44284/11), Nuraliyevy (no. 48134/11) and Sangariyevy (no. 52182/11)).6.
The applicants complained to law-enforcement bodies, and official investigations were opened. The proceedings were repeatedly suspended and resumed, and have remained pending for several years without achieving any tangible results.7.
From the documents submitted, it appears that the relevant State authorities were unable to identify the State servicemen allegedly involved in the arrests or abductions.8.
In their observations, the Government did not challenge the allegations as presented by the applicants. At the same time, they stated that there was no evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that State agents had been involved in the alleged abductions.9.
Below are summaries of the facts relevant to each individual complaint. Each account of events is based on statements provided by the applicants, their relatives and/or neighbours to the Court and to the domestic investigative authorities. The personal data of the applicants and their disappeared relatives, and some other key facts, are summarised in Appendix I.A.
Application no. 25088/11, Petimat Ismailova v. Russia10.
The applicant, Ms Petimat Ismailova (in the documents submitted also referred to as Baskhanova), was born in 1980, and lives in Katyr‑Yurt in the Achkhoy-Martan district, the Chechen Republic. She is represented before the Court by lawyers from the NGO Materi Chechni.11.
The applicant is the wife of Mr Ruslan Baskhanov, who was born in 1980.1.
Abduction of Mr Ruslan Baskhanov12.
At the material time, the applicant and her husband Mr Ruslan Baskhanov lived in Achkhoy-Martan, Chechnya. Their house was situated in proximity to the Achkhoy-Martan district military commander’s office.13.
At about 3 a.m. on 6 January 2004 a group of about fifteen masked servicemen in camouflage uniforms arrived at the applicant’s house in two armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and took Mr Ruslan Baskhanov away.14.
There has been no news of Mr Ruslan Baskhanov since that day.2.
Official investigation15.
The Government furnished a copy of “the contents of the entire criminal case file” without specifying the number of pages. The information submitted may be summarised as follows.(a)
Main investigative steps taken by the investigators16.
On 9 January 2004 the applicant reported the abduction, and on 15 January 2004 the Achkhoy-Martan inter-district prosecutor’s office opened criminal case no. 38002.17.
On 15 January 2004 investigators examined the crime scene and collected three bullet cartridges. The expert examination they carried out subsequently concluded that they had been fired from various types of firearms.18.
On 26 April 2004 the military prosecutor’s office of military unit no. 20102 replied to the investigators, denying that military servicemen had been involved in the abduction.19.
On 15 May 2004 the investigation was suspended.20.
From the documents submitted, it appears that on an unspecified date in July 2007 the investigation was resumed, several witnesses were questioned (see paragraph 29 below) and the proceedings were then suspended.21.
On 11 June 2008 the investigation was again resumed, and on 16 July 2008 it was again suspended. The applicant was not informed thereof.22.
On 24 March 2009 the supervising prosecutor ordered that the investigation be resumed as the investigators had failed to take a number of basic steps, such as establishing the owners of the APCs used by the abductors and granting the applicant victim status in the criminal case. On the same date the orders were given, the applicant was granted victim status and the proceedings were resumed.23.
On 28 March 2009 the investigation was suspended again. The applicant was informed thereof.24.
On 21 April 2012 the investigation was resumed again. It is still pending.(b)

On an unspecified date in January 2004 the investigators questioned the applicant, whose statement concerning the events was similar to the account submitted to the Court. In addition, she told the investigators that the perpetrators of her husband’s abduction had been federal servicemen.27.
On 22 January 2004 the applicant’s relative and the aunt of Mr Ruslan Baskhanov, Ms A.M., wrote to the Chechnya prosecutor’s office, stating that on an unspecified date between 6 and 21 January 2004 she had been invited by the head of the Achkhoy-Martan District Department of the Interior (ROVD) to a meeting with law-enforcement and military officers at the police station. During the meeting, she had pointed out to those present that the military commander had acknowledged that Mr Ruslan Baskhanov had been detained on 6 January 2004 by a law-enforcement agency. From the documents submitted, it transpires that no steps were taken by the investigators to verify this information.28.
Between February 2004 and May 2005 the investigators questioned about thirty of the applicant’s relatives and neighbours, all of whom provided statements similar to the account furnished by the applicant to the Court.29.
On 18 July 2007 the investigators questioned another four of the applicant’s relatives and neighbours, whose statements did not yield any new information.30.
On various dates between 1 and 10 July 2008 the investigators questioned several more of the applicant’s relatives and neighbours, whose statements did not yield any new information either.31.
On 24 March 2009 the applicant was questioned again. She reiterated her previous statements.(c)
The applicant’s contact with the authorities32.
On 3 June 2004 the investigators replied to a request by the applicant for information, stating that they had taken a number of steps to establish the whereabouts of her abducted husband and that even though on 15 May 2004 the proceedings had been suspended, the measures to identify the perpetrators and establish her husband’s whereabouts were still in progress.33.
On 26 November 2008 the Achkhoy-Martan District Court declared Mr Ruslan Baskhanov missing.34.
On 24 February 2009 in reply to a request by the applicant of 27 January 2009, the investigators informed her that she had the right to review only certain documents from the investigation file, but not its entire contents.35.
On 11 October 2010 the Achkhoy-Martan District Court partially allowed a complaint by the applicant against the decision to suspend the investigation of 28 March 2009 and ordered the investigators to take all necessary steps.B.

Threatening to blow up the dwelling, they took Mr Said-Khussein Sangariyev outside and made him kneel against the wall, demanding that he tell them where his nephews Mr Said-Ibragim Sangariyev and Mr Idris Sangariyev were. The servicemen then searched the house looking for the two cousins; about an hour later they found them and dragged them outside. The servicemen then reported the arrest to their superiors via portable radios using the code numbers ‘22-23-43’. Afterwards, they took Mr Said-Ibragim Sangariyev’s car, a VAZ-2107 with registration number C96 AP 20RUS, put both cousins inside and drove them off in the direction of Grozny.

At about 4 a.m. on 12 November 2002 a group of armed servicemen in camouflage uniforms and masks arrived at the applicants’ house in two APCs and a VAZ car. They broke into the house, quickly searched it, took Mr Usman Salamov outside, forced him into one of the APCs and drove off.273.
On the same night at least one other resident of the village was allegedly abducted by the same group of servicemen (see the case of Ilyasova v. Russia, no. 26966/06, §§ 7 and 112, 10 June 2010).274.
Later the same day at about 4 .30 p.m. the policemen from the Achkhoy-Martan ROVD arrived at the applicants’ house and dug two plastic barrels with firearms and ammunition out of their garden.275.
The applicants have not seen their relative since 12 November 2002.2.

Abduction of Mr Imran Dashtayev and Mr Idris Akhmadov298.
According to the applicants, who all live on the same street, on 20 July 2003 the Russian federal forces conducted a sweeping-up operation in Noviye Atagi, as a result of which at least three local residents were arrested, including the applicants’ relatives. Military checkpoints were situated on all of the roads leading to and from the settlement. The area was under curfew.299.
At about 5 a.m. on 20 July 2003 a convoy of military vehicles, consisting of at least three APCs (with hull numbers 100, 101 and F-121), one URAL lorry (with registration number 75-99 6 RUS) and a UAZ all‑terrain car, arrived at the applicants’ street. A group of about fifty heavily-armed military servicemen in camouflage uniforms got out of the vehicles and broke into at least four houses in the street, including those of the applicants.300.
A group of about fifteen servicemen climbed over the fence and broke into the house of the Akhmadov family. They checked the identity documents of the male residents, quickly searched the house without producing a warrant or giving any explanation for their actions and took Mr Idris Akhmadov outside. The servicemen also took some of the family’s valuables. They put Mr Idris Akhmadov into the UAZ minivan, and then they dragged him out and forced him into the APC and drove off.301.
At about 5.30 a.m. a group of fifteen to twenty servicemen in a yellow UAL lorry with registration number 75 99 86 broke into the house of the Dashtayev family. Several APCs and a UAZ minivan were waiting on a neighbouring street. They found Mr Imran Dashtayev in the yard and demanded his passport. His passport had been submitted for renewal, so the servicemen told his relatives that they would take him away for an identity check. They then forced him into the yellow lorry and drove off.302.
The applicants have not seen their relatives since 20 July 2003.2.

On 21 July 2003 the investigators questioned the sixth and eighth applicants, whose detailed accounts of the abduction were similar to the account submitted to the Court.312.
On the same date the investigators questioned a local resident, Mr I.T., who had been detained by the same group of abductors on the same night. He stated that he had been beaten by them, questioned about his involvement in illegal armed groups and then released later that evening.313.
The investigators also questioned the seventh applicant and two of the applicants’ neighbours, Mr Kh.S. and Ms E.M. that day, whose statements corroborated those of the sixth and eighth applicants.314.
On 24 July 2003 the investigators questioned officer D.K. who manned checkpoint no. 112 in the vicinity of the applicants’ settlement. According to him, on the night of 19 July 2003 a convoy of forty vehicles from the Security Service of the Chechen President had passed though the checkpoint two times: during the evening and then the following morning.315.
On 4 August 2003 the investigators questioned officer A.P., who was stationed with his military unit no. 2 on the premises of the old mill on the outskirts of Noviye Atagi. He denied having any knowledge of either a special operation in the settlement or the vehicles used by the abductors.316.
On 22 June 2005 the investigators questioned the eighth applicant again, who reiterated his previous statement.317.
On 14 and 17 April 2008 the investigators questioned the eighth applicant’s relative, Mr I.A., and his neighbour, Mr Sh.I., whose statements corroborated those of the eighth applicant.(c)

In reply to numerous complaints by the applicants lodged on various dates between 2004 and 2011 about the abduction, the investigators gave similar replies to the effect that the investigation was in progress and that they were taking all possible measures to have the crime solved.II.
RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE AND INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS323.
For a summary of the relevant domestic law and practice and for international and domestic reports on disappearances in Chechnya and Ingushetia, see Aslakhanova and Others v. Russia, (nos. 2944/06, 8300/07, 50184/07, 332/08 and 42509/10, §§ 43-59 and §§ 69-84, 18 December 2012).THE LAWI.
JOINDER OF THE APPLICATIONS324.
In accordance with Rule 42 § 1 of the Rules of Court, the Court decides to join the applications, given their similar factual and legal background.II.
THE GOVERNMENT’S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONA.
Compliance with the six-month ruleThe parties’ submissions(a)
Government325.
In their observations in respect of all the applications, the Government submitted that the applicants had failed to comply with the six‑month rule by lodging their applications with the Court after unreasonably long periods of time since the abductions and institution of criminal proceedings. Referring to the case of Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC] (nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, ECHR 2009), they claimed that the applicants had failed to provide explanations for their excessive delays in applying to Strasbourg.(b)
The applicants326.
The applicants argued that they had complied with the six-month rule, and that there had been no excessive and unexplained delays in the submission of their applications to the Court.327.
The applicants stated that after the criminal investigations had been initiated, they had had no reason to doubt their effectiveness. They pointed out that the armed conflict in Chechnya had led them to believe that delays in the investigations were inevitable. Moreover, owing to their poor command of Russian, their lack of legal knowledge and lack of funds to hire a lawyer, they had been unable to assess the effectiveness of the investigation in the absence of domestic provisions for free legal assistance to victims of enforced disappearances. As soon as the applicants had received legal aid and gained access to the investigation file, they had realised that the investigations had been ineffective and applied to the Court. Also referring to the Varnava and others case, cited above, they argued that the six-month rule did not apply to continuing situations such as cases of enforced disappearances.B.
The Court’s assessment1.
General principles328.
The Court will examine the arguments of the parties in the light of the provisions of the Convention and its relevant practice (see Estamirov and Others v. Russia, no. 60272/00, §§ 73-74, 12 October 2006).329.
As to the Government’s argument concerning the applicants’ failure to comply with the six-month time-limit, the Court notes that the time-limit implies that the applicants should have brought their applications to the Court within six months of the final domestic decisions or within six months of the date they became aware of the ineffectiveness of the domestic remedies (see, for example, Varnava and Others, cited above, § 157). The Court notes that the Government acknowledged the absence of a particular date or decision which could serve as a trigger for the calculation of the time-limit. Furthermore, they argued that the applicants’ complaints were premature, as the criminal investigations were still in progress.330.
The Court reiterates that the purpose of the six-month rule is to promote legal certainty, to ensure that cases are dealt with within a reasonable time and to protect the parties from uncertainty for a prolonged period of time. The rule also provides the opportunity to ascertain the facts of the case before memory of them fades away with time (see Abuyeva and Others v. Russia, no. 27065/05, § 175, 2 December 2010).331.
Normally, the six-month period runs from the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. In its absence, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of. Where an applicant avails himself of an existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, the six-month time‑limit is calculated from the date the applicant first became, or ought to have become, aware of those circumstances (see, among other authorities, Zenin v. Russia (dec.), no. 15413/03, 24 September 2009).332.
In cases concerning disappearances, unlike in cases concerning ongoing investigations into the deaths of applicants’ relatives (see, for example, Elsanova v. Russia (dec.) no. 57952/00, 15 November 2005, and Narin v. Turkey, no. 18907/02, § 50, 15 December 2009), the Court has held that taking into account the uncertainty and confusion typical of such situations, the nature of the ensuing investigations implies that the relatives of a disappeared person may be justified in waiting lengthy periods of time for the national authorities to conclude their proceedings, even if the latter are sporadic and plagued by problems. However, where more than ten years have elapsed since the incident, the applicants have to justify the delay in lodging their application with the Court (see Varnava and Others, cited above, §§ 162‑63).333.
Applying the Varnava principles, the Court recently found in the case of Er and Others v. Turkey (no. 23016/04, §§ 55-58, 31 July 2012) that the applicants, who had waited for almost ten years after the disappearance of their relative before lodging their application, had complied with the six‑month rule because an investigation was being conducted at the national level. The Court reached a similar conclusion in another case, where the domestic investigation into the events had been pending for more than eight years and where the applicants were doing all that could be expected of them to assist the authorities (see Bozkır and Others v. Turkey, no. 24589/04, § 49, 26 February 2013).334.
By contrast, the Court has declared inadmissible applications where applicants have waited for more than ten years to lodge their applications with the Court, and where there had been, for a long time, no evidence allowing them to believe that the investigation would be effective. For instance, in the case of Yetişen and Others v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 21099/06, 10 July 2012), the applicants waited for four years after the disappearance before lodging an official complaint with the competent investigating authorities, and for eleven and a half years before bringing their application to Strasbourg; in the case of Findik and Omer v. Turkey ((decs.), nos. 33898/11 and 35798/11, 9 October 2012), the applications were brought to Strasbourg more than fifteen years after the events; and in the case of Taşçi and Duman v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 40787/10, 9 October 2012), the applicants applied to Strasbourg twenty-three years after the disappearance. In those cases, as in the case of Açış v. Turkey (no. 7050/05, §§ 41-42, 1 February 2011), where the applicants complained to Strasbourg more than twelve years after the disappearance, the Court rejected as out of time their complaints under Article 2 of the Convention for failure to demonstrate any concrete advance in the domestic investigation to justify their delay of more than ten years.2.
Application of the principles to the present case335.
Turning to the circumstances of each of the applications at hand, the Court notes that the criminal investigation in each was pending when the applicants lodged their complaints with the Court. Further, the Court notes that in the applications Petimat Ismailova (no. 25088/11), Idigova and Others (no. 44277/11), Vezirov and Others (no. 44284/11), Ismailova and Others (no. 44313/11), and Khamstkhanova (no. 49486/11) the applicants complained to the authorities shortly after the abduction and lodged their application with the Court between five and half to approximately eight years after the events. From the documents submitted, it appears that they maintained contact with the authorities by providing the investigators with eyewitness evidence, requesting information and asking for permission to have access to the investigation files.336.
As regards the other seven applications, in which the applicants applied to Strasbourg after a longer period of time, ranging from the beginning of the domestic investigation to between eight and ten and half years after the events, the Court notes the following.337.
In the application Nuraliyevy (no. 48134/11), the applicants complained about the abduction shortly after the incident, in June 2002, and lodged their application with the Court nine years after the events. From the documents submitted, it appears that throughout that period they maintained contact with the authorities by regularly providing witness statements and lodging requests for information concerning the whereabouts of their abducted relative. In December 2006 the first applicant provided the investigators with important information about the perpetrators’ identity. However, no action was taken to follow this information up and moreover, the proceedings were suspended two days later and the applicants were not informed thereof. In May 2010, having learnt of the suspension of the investigation in December 2006, the applicants immediately complained to the domestic court attempting to persuade the authorities to resume the proceedings and then in July 2011 lodged their application with the Court.338.
In the application Aguyeva and Others (no.52076/11), the Court notes that the applicants lodged their application eight and half years after the abduction and initiation of the investigation in January 2003. The investigation lasted for three months, and in April 2003 was suspended. The applicants were only informed of this in December 2004. For six years the proceedings remained suspended, and no active steps were taken by the authorities until May 2009, when the proceedings were resumed following a complaint by the applicant to that effect. From the documents submitted, it appears that during the six‑year lull in the investigation, the applicants, having remained passive for more than three years within that period, contacted the authorities in September 2008, complaining of a lack of information about the investigation. Thereafter, they took a more active stance in the proceedings.339.
In the application Sangariyeva and Others (no.52182/11), the Court notes that the applicants lodged their complaint in August 2011, almost ten and half years after the abduction and initiation of the investigation. From the documents submitted, it appears that the investigation was suspended and resumed on numerous occasions and that the applicants maintained regular contact with the authorities by providing witness statements and regularly enquiring about the progress of the proceedings. In February 2008 the domestic court granted a request they lodged in the hope that the progress of the investigation would be expedited. Having waited for almost three more years, in the absence any tangible outcome in the investigation, the applicants lodged their application with the Court. From the documents submitted it follows there were no long periods of inactivity on the part of the applicants or any significant lulls in the criminal proceedings.340.
Further, in the application Nutayevy (no.55055/11) the applicants lodged their application with the Court eight and half years after the abduction and initiation of the investigation in February 2003. From the documents submitted, it appears that on several occasions between 2003 and 2006 the applicants provided the authorities with witness statements. In April 2006 the investigation, having been repeatedly suspended and resumed, was suspended and remained adjourned until April 2012. The applicants were informed of the suspension in April 2006 and contacted the authorities in June 2008, December 2009 and August 2010, enquiring about the progress of the proceedings. In January and August 2010 the authorities informed them that the investigation was still suspended; in April 2011 the applicants requested that the proceedings be resumed. In the absence of any reply from the authorities, in August 2011 the applicants lodged their application with the Court, which spurred the resumption of the proceedings in April 2012.341.
In the applications Saltuyevy (no. 56574/11) and Dashtayev and Others (no. 66831/11), the Court observes that the applicants lodged their respective applications eight years and ten months and eight years and three months after the abduction and commencement of the domestic investigation. From the documents submitted, it appears that in both cases the applicants maintained regular contact with the authorities by providing statements and lodging numerous requests concerning the progress of the proceedings.342.
As for the application Salamov and Others (no. 64266/11), the Court notes that the applicants lodged their complaint eight years and ten months after the abduction and initiation of the investigation. From the documents submitted, it appears that there were no significant lulls in the proceedings, even though they were repeatedly suspended and resumed. On several occasions between 2003 and 2008 the applicants and their relatives provided witness statements and in July 2009 took a more active stance in the proceedings by complaining of a lack of information about their progress. The Court considers that the applicants maintained reasonable contact with the investigation.343.
To sum up, all of the applicants maintained reasonable contact with the authorities, cooperated with the investigation and, where appropriate, took steps to obtain information about the progress of the proceedings and expedite them, in the hope of a more effective outcome.344.
The Court considers that investigations were being conducted, albeit sporadically, during the periods in question and that the applicants did all that could be expected of them to assist the authorities (see Varnava and Others, cited above, § 166, and Er and Others, cited above, § 60). In the light of the foregoing, the Court dismisses the Government’s objection as to the admissibility of these complaints based on the six-month time-limit.III.
THE COURT’S ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FACTSA.
The parties’ submissions1.
The Government345.
The Government did not contest the essential facts of each application as presented by the applicants. At the same time, they claimed that none of the investigations had obtained information proving that the applicants’ relatives had been apprehended and detained by State agents. According to them, there was no evidence proving beyond reasonable doubt that State agents had been involved in the abductions. The mere fact that the abductors had been armed and/or had driven a certain type of vehicle was not enough to presume the contrary. In addition, the Government stated that the abductions had been perpetrated in various districts of the region, that in the applications Aguyeva and Others (no. 52076/11) and Sangariyevy (no. 52182/11) the abductors had demanded a ransom for the return of the applicants’ relatives and that in Aguyeva and Others (no. 52076/11) the abductors had spoken Chechen.2.
The applicants346.
The applicants submitted that it had been established “beyond reasonable doubt” that the men who had taken their relatives away had been State agents. In support of that assertion they referred to the ample evidence contained in their submissions and the criminal investigation files, in so far as they had been disclosed by the Government. They also submitted that they had each made a prima facie case that their relatives had been abducted by State agents and that the essential facts underlying their complaints had not been challenged by the Government. In view of the absence of any news of their relatives for a long time and the life-threatening nature of unacknowledged detention in Chechnya at the relevant time, they asked the Court to consider their relatives dead.B.
General principles347.
The Court will examine each of the applications in the light of the general principles applicable in cases where the factual circumstances are in dispute between the parties (see El Masri v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” [GC], no. 39630/09, §§ 151-53, ECHR‑2012).348.
The Court has addressed a whole series of cases concerning allegations of disappearances in the Chechen Republic. Applying the above‑mentioned principles, it has concluded that it would be sufficient for the applicants to make a prima facie case of abduction by servicemen, thus falling within the control of the authorities, and it would then be for the Government to discharge their burden of proof either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred (see, among many examples, Kosumova and Others v. Russia, no. 27441/07, § 67, 7 June 2011, and Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, § 99). If the Government failed to rebut that presumption, this would entail a violation of Article 2 in its substantive part. Conversely, where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (see, for example, Tovsultanova v. Russia, no. 26974/06, §§ 77-81, 17 June 2010; Movsayevy v. Russia, no. 20303/07, § 76, 14 June 2011; and Shafiyeva v. Russia, no. 49379/09, § 71, 3 May 2012).349.
The Court has also found in many cases concerning disappearances in Chechnya that a missing person could be presumed dead. Having regard to the numerous cases of disappearances in the region which have come before it, the Court has found that in the particular context of the conflict, when a person was detained by unidentified State agents without any subsequent acknowledgment of the detention, this could be regarded as life‑threatening (see, among many other authorities, Bazorkina v. Russia, no. 69481/01, 27 July 2006; Imakayeva v. Russia, no. 7615/02, ECHR 2006‑XIII; Luluyev and Others v. Russia, no. 69480/01, ECHR 2006‑VIII; Baysayeva v. Russia, no. 74237/01, 5 April 2007; Akhmadova and Sadulayeva v. Russia, no. 40464/02, 10 May 2007; Alikhadzhiyeva v. Russia, no. 68007/01, 5 July 2007; and Dubayev and Bersnukayeva v. Russia, nos. 30613/05 and 30615/05, 11 February 2010).350.
The Court has made findings of presumptions of deaths in the absence of any reliable news about the disappeared persons for periods ranging from four years (see Askhabova v. Russia, no. 54765/09, § 137, 18 April 2013) to more than ten years.C.
Application of the principles to the present case1.
Application no. 25088/11, Petimat Ismailova v. Russia351.
A number of witness statements collected by the applicant, along with the documents from the investigation file furnished by the Government (see, for example, paragraphs 26 and 27 above), demonstrate that the applicant’s husband, Mr Ruslan Baskhanov, was abducted on 6 January 2004 by a group of armed servicemen in Achkhoy-Martan.

Conclusions387.
The Court finds that in all of the applications the applicants’ relatives were abducted by armed men in uniforms, displaying behaviour characteristic of security operations. Their behaviour and appearance, their ability to pass through roadblocks and cordon off areas, along with their use of vehicles, in all probability, lead the Court to conclude that they could be none other than State servicemen. The applicants’ allegations are supported by the witness statements and other evidence collected by them and by the investigations. In their submissions to the authorities, the applicants maintained that their relatives had been abducted by State agents. The domestic investigations accepted as fact the versions of events presented by the applicants and took steps to check whether State servicemen had been involved in the abductions. As it appears from the documents, the investigations regarded the possibility of abduction by servicemen as the only, or at least the main, plausible explanation for the events.388.
In summary, the facts of all the applications contain sufficient evidence to enable the Court to make findings about the carrying out of security operations and thus about the State’s exclusive control over the detainees (see, among many other authorities, Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, § 114). The Government’s arguments are limited to references to the unfinished criminal investigations, or are of a speculative nature and stand in contradiction to the evidence reviewed by the Court. In any case, they are insufficient to discharge them of the burden of proof which has been shifted to them in such cases.389.
The detention in life-threatening circumstances of Mr Ruslan Baskhanov, Mr Magomed Khamzatov, Mr Kharun Vezirov, Mr Askhab Vezirov, Mr Aslambek Isayev, Mr Daud Nuraliyev, Mr Khalid Nuraliyev, Mr Iles Khamstkhanov, Mr Dzhandar Ismailov, Mr Dzhalil Ismailov, Mr Said-Ibragim Sangariyev, Mr Idris Sangariyev, Mr Saykhan Nutayev, Mr Aslanbek Saltuyev, Mr Usman Salamov, Mr Idris Akhmatov and Mr Imran Dashtayev, together with the long absence of any news of them, leads the Court to conclude that they may be presumed dead.IV.
ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 2 OF THE CONVENTION390.
The applicants complained, under Article 2 of the Convention, that their relatives had disappeared after having been detained by State agents and that the domestic authorities had failed to carry out effective investigations into the matters. Article 2 reads as follows:“1.
Everyone’s right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.2.
Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:(a)
in defence of any person from unlawful violence;(b)
in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;(c)
in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.”A.
The parties’ submissions391.
The Government contended that the domestic investigations had found no evidence to suggest that the applicants’ relatives had been held under State control or that they were dead. They further noted that the mere fact that the investigative measures had not produced any specific results, or had given only limited ones, did not mean that there were any omissions on the part of the investigative authorities. They claimed that all necessary steps were being taken to comply with theobligation to conduct an effective investigation.392.
The applicants reiterated their complaints.B.
The Court’s assessment1.
Admissibility393.
The Court considers, in the light of the parties’ submissions, that the complaints raise serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which requires an examination of the merits. The complaint under Article 2 of the Convention must therefore be declared admissible.2.
Merits(a)
Alleged violation of the right to life of the applicants’ relatives394.
The Court has already found that in all of the applications under examination, the applicants’ relatives may be presumed dead, following their unacknowledged detention by State agents. In the absence of any justification put forward by the Government, the Court finds that their deaths can be attributed to the State and that there has been a violation of the substantive aspect of Article 2 of the Convention in respect of Mr Ruslan Baskhanov, Mr Magomed Khamzatov, Mr Kharun Vezirov, Mr Askhab Vezirov, Mr Aslambek Isayev , Mr Daud Nuraliyev, Mr Khalid Nuraliyev, Mr Iles Khamstkhanov, Mr Dzhandar Ismailov, Mr Dzhalil Ismailov, Mr Said‑Ibragim Sangariyev, Mr Idris Sangariyev, Mr Saykhan Nutayev, Mr Aslanbek Saltuyev, Mr Usman Salamov, Mr Idris Akhmatov and Mr Imran Dashtayev.(b)
Alleged inadequacy of the investigations into the abductions395.
The Court has already found that a criminal investigation does not constitute an effective remedy in respect of disappearances which have occurred in Chechnya between 1999 and 2006, and that such a situation constitutes a systemic problem in Convention terms (see Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, § 217). In the cases at hand, as in many previous similar cases reviewed by the Court, the investigations have been pending for many years without bringing about any significant developments as to the identities of the perpetrators or the fate of the applicants’ missing relatives. While the obligation to investigate effectively is one of means and not of results, the Court notes that each set of criminal proceedings has been plagued by a combination of defects such as those enumerated in the Aslakhanova and Others judgment (cited above, §§ 123‑25).396.
In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the authorities failed to carry out effective criminal investigations into the circumstances of the disappearances and deaths of Mr Ruslan Baskhanov, Mr Magomed Khamzatov, Mr Kharun Vezirov, Mr Askhab Vezirov, Mr Aslambek Isayev, Mr Daud Nuraliyev, Mr Khalid Nuraliyev, Mr Iles Khamstkhanov, Mr Dzhandar Ismailov, Mr Dzhalil Ismailov, Mr Said-Ibragim Sangariyev, Mr Idris Sangariyev, Mr Saykhan Nutayev, Mr Aslanbek Saltuyev, Mr Usman Salamov, Mr Imran Dashtayev and Mr Idris Akhmatov. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in its procedural aspect.V.
ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 3, 5 AND 13 OF THE CONVENTION397.
The applicants complained of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the mental suffering caused to them by the disappearance of their relatives and under Article 5 of the Convention of the unlawfulness of their relatives’ detention. They also argued that, contrary to Article 13 of the Convention, they had no domestic remedies at their disposal against the alleged violations, in particular those under Articles 2 and 3. Articles 3, 5 and 13 read, in so far as relevant, as follows:Article 3“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”Article 5“1.
Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:...(c)
the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;...2.
Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him.3.
Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.4.
Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.5.
Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an enforceable right to compensation.”Article 13“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”A.
The parties’ submissions398.
The Government contested the applicants’ claims.399.
The applicants reiterated their complaints.B.
The Court’s assessment1.
Admissibility400.
The Court notes that these complaints are not manifestly ill‑founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible.2.
Merits401.
The Court has found on many occasions that a situation of enforced disappearance gives rise to a violation of Article 3 in respect of the close relatives of the victim. The essence of such a violation does not lie mainly in the fact of the “disappearance” of the family member, but rather concerns the authorities’ reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention (see Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, § 358, 18 June 2002, and Imakayeva, cited above, § 164). Where news about the missing person’s death is preceded by a sufficiently long period when he or she had been deemed disappeared, there exists a distinct period during which the applicants sustained uncertainty, anguish and distress characteristic to the specific phenomenon of disappearances (see Luluyev and Others v. Russia, no.
69480/01, § 115, ECHR 2006‑XIII (extracts)).402.
Equally, the Court has found on many occasions that unacknowledged detention is a complete negation of the guarantees contained in Article 5 and discloses a particularly grave violation of its provisions (see Çiçek v. Turkey, no. 25704/94, § 164, 27 February 2001, and Luluyev, cited above, § 122).403. The Court reiterates its findings regarding the State’s responsibility for the abductions and the failure to carry out meaningful investigations into the fates of the disappeared persons. It finds that the applicants, who are close relatives of the disappeared, must be considered victims of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the distress and anguish which they suffered, and continue to suffer, as a result of their inability to ascertain the fate of their family members and of the manner in which their complaints have been dealt with.404.
The Court furthermore confirms that since it has been established that the applicants’ relatives were detained by State agents, it appears without any legal grounds or acknowledgement of such detention, this constitutes a particularly grave violation of the right to liberty and security of persons enshrined in Article 5 of the Convention.405.
The Court reiterates its findings of the general ineffectiveness of the criminal investigations in applications such as those under examination. In the absence of the results of the criminal investigation, any other possible remedy becomes inaccessible in practice.406.
The Court thus finds that the applicants in these applications did not have an effective domestic remedy at their disposal for their grievances under Articles 2 and 3, in breach of Article 13 of the Convention (see, for example, Aslakhanova and Others, cited above, §157).VI.
ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION407.
The applicants in the application Dashtayev and Others (no. 66831/11) complained that the search carried out by the perpetrators of the abduction constituted a violation of the seventh and eighth applicants’ right to respect for their home. Article 8 of the Convention which reads as follows:“1.
Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.2.
There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. ”408.
In their observations on the admissibility and merits of the application, the applicants stated that they no longer wished to maintain this complaint.409.
The Court, having regard to Article 37 of the Convention, notes that the applicants do not intend to pursue this part of the application, within the meaning of Article 37 § 1 (a). It finds no reasons of a general character affecting respect for human rights as defined in the Convention which require a further examination of the present complaints by virtue of Article 37 § 1 of the Convention in fine (see, among other authorities, Stamatios Karagiannis v. Greece, no. 27806/02, § 28, 10 February 2005, and Gekhayeva and Others v. Russia, no. 1755/04, § 146, 29 May 2008).410.
It follows that this part of the application must be struck out in accordance with Article 37 § 1 (a) of the Convention.VII.
OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION411.
The Court has examined the other complaints submitted by the applicants in the applications Aguyeva and Others (no. 52076/11) and Sangariyevy (no. 52182/11) under Articles 3 and 8 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. However, having regard to all the material in its possession, and in so far as those complaints fall within the Court’s competence, it finds that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols. It follows that this part of the application must be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.VIII.
APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION412.
Article 41 of the Convention provides:“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”A.

The Government445.
The Government submitted in respect of each application that the applicants’ claims for damages were unsubstantiated. They further maintained that the finding of a violation would constitute sufficient just satisfaction for the applicants.446.
The Government further stated in respect of each application that the applicants’ claims for costs and expenses were unsubstantiated, as it had not been shown that the expenses claimed had actually been incurred. They also commented that the application forms and observations submitted by the applicants’ representatives were very similar to each other, and therefore the time and effort spent on the preparation of the documents did not correspond to the amounts claimed. In particular, in respect of claims made by the representatives in the applications Petimat Ismailova (no.25088/11), Nuralieyvy (no. 48134/11) and Salamov and Others (no. 34622/11), the Government pointed out that the observations “consisted of one page written in English”; the amount of legal research and preparation was not duly justified and no copies of documents substantiating the postage and administrative expenses were furnished by the applicants’ representatives.D.
The Court’s assessment447.
The Court reiterates that there must be a clear causal connection between the damages claimed by the applicants and the violation of the Convention, and that this may, where appropriate, include compensation in respect of loss of earnings. The Court further finds that a loss of earnings may be claimed by close relatives of a disappeared person, including spouses, elderly parents and minor children (see, among other authorities, Imakayeva, cited above, § 213).448.
Whenever the Court finds a violation of the Convention, it may accept that the applicants have suffered non-pecuniary damage which cannot be compensated for solely by the finding of a violation, and make a financial award.449.
As to costs and expenses, the Court first has to establish whether the costs and expenses indicated by the applicants’ representatives were actually incurred and secondly, whether they were necessary (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, § 220, Series A no. 324, and Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, § 147, ECHR 2005-IV).450.
Having regard to the foregoing conclusions, the principles enumerated above and the parties’ submissions, the Court awards the amounts to the applicants as detailed in Appendix II, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicants on those amounts. The awards in respect of costs and expenses are to be paid into the representatives’ bank accounts, as specified by the applicants.E.
Default interest451.
The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT, UNANIMOUSLY,1.
Decides to join the applications; 2.
Decides to strike the applications out of its list of cases in accordance with Article 37 § 1 (a) of the Convention in so far as it concerns the complaints under Article 8 of the Convention in the application of Dashtayev and Others (no. 66831/11); 3.

Holds that there has been a procedural violation of Article 2 of the Convention in respect of the failure to investigate the disappearance of the applicants’ relatives; 6.
Holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in respect of the applicants, on account of their relatives’ disappearance and the authorities’ response to their suffering; 7.
Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 of the Convention in respect of the applicants’ relatives on account of their unlawful detention; 8.
Holds there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention in conjunction with Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention; 9.
Holds(a)
that the respondent State is to pay the applicants, within three months of the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the amounts as indicated in Appendix II, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicants. The payments in respect of costs and expenses to the applicants’ representatives are to be made to the representatives’ bank accounts as indicated by the applicants; the payments are to be made in euros in respect of the applicants represented by SRJI/Astreya, and to be converted into the currency of the respondent State in respect of the applicants represented by Mr D. Itslayev, Mr T. Shamsudinov and the NGO Materi Chechni;(b)
that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points; 10.
Dismisses the remainder of the applicants’ claim for just satisfaction.
