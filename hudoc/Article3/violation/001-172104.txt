THIRD SECTION    CASE OF MOZHAROV AND OTHERS v. RUSSIA(Applications nos. 16401/12 and 9 others -see appended list)      JUDGMENT  STRASBOURG 21 March 2017  FINAL 18/09/2017 This judgment has become final under Article 44 § 2 of the Convention. It may be subject to editorial revision. In the case of Mozharov and Others v. Russia,The European Court of Human Rights (Third Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:Helena Jäderblom, President,Branko Lubarda,Luis López Guerra,Helen Keller,Dmitry Dedov,Pere Pastor Vilanova,Alena Poláčková, judges,and Stephen Phillips, Section Registrar,Having deliberated in private on 28 February 2017,Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date:PROCEDURE1.
The case originated in applications against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) on the various dates indicted in the appended table.2.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.3.
The applications were communicated to the Government.THE FACTS4.
The list of applicants and the relevant details of the applications are set out in the appended table.5.
The applicants complained of the inadequate conditions of their detention. They also raised other complaints under the provisions of the Convention.THE LAWI.
JOINDER OF THE APPLICATIONS6.
Having regard to the similar subject matter of the applications, the Court finds it appropriate to examine them jointly in a single judgment.II.
ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION7.
The applicants complained principally of the inadequate conditions of their detention. They relied on Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows: “No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”8.
The Court notes that the applicants were kept in detention in poor conditions. The details of the applicants’ detention are indicated in the appended table. The Court refers to the principles established in its case-law regarding inadequate conditions of detention (see, for instance, Muršić v. Croatia [GC], no. 7334/13, §§ 91-141, ECHR 2016; Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, §§ 90-94, ECHR 2000-XI, and Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, §§ 139-165, 10 January 2012). It reiterates in particular that extreme lack of space in a prison cell or overcrowding weighs heavily as an aspect to be taken into account for the purpose of establishing whether the impugned detention conditions were “degrading” from the point of view of Article 3 and may disclose a violation, both alone or taken together with other shortcomings (see, amongst many authorities, Karalevičius v. Lithuania, no. 53254/99, §§ 36 ‑ 40, 7 April 2005).9.
In the leading case of Sergey Babushkin v. Russia (no. 5993/08, 28 November 2013), the Court already found a violation in respect of issues similar to those in the present case.10.
Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court has not found any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion on the admissibility and merits of these complaints. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the applicants’ conditions of detention were inadequate.11.
These complaints are therefore admissible and disclose a breach of Article 3 of the Convention.III.
REMAINING COMPLAINTS12.
The applicants submitted other complaints which also raised issues under the Convention, in accordance with the relevant well-established case-law of the Court (see appended table). These complaints are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention, nor are they inadmissible on any other ground. Accordingly, they must be declared admissible. Having examined all the material before it, the Court concludes that they also disclose violations of the Convention in the light of its findings in Sergey Babushkin case (cited above, §§ 38-45).IV.
APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION13.
Article 41 of the Convention provides: “If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”14.
Regard being had to the documents in its possession, to its case-law (see, in particular, Butko v. Russia, no. 32036/10, 12 November 2015 and Sergey Babushkin v. Russia, (just satisfaction), no. 5993/08, 16 October 2014) and the long delay for some of the applicants in filing the application, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sums indicated in the appended table.15.
The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT, UNANIMOUSLY,1.
Decides to join the applications; 2.
Declares the applications admissible; 3.
Holds that these applications disclose a breach of Article 3 of the Convention concerning the inadequate conditions of detention; 4.
Holds that there has been a violation as regards the other complaints raised under well-established case-law of the Court (see appended table); 5.
Holds(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicants, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the amounts indicated in the appended table, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points.
