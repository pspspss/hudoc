The last two numbers indicate thecase's position on the list of cases referred to the Court since itscreation and on the list of the corresponding originatingapplications to the Commission. ** As amended by Article 11 of Protocol No. 8 (P8-11), which cameinto force on 1 January 1990._______________ PROCEDURE 1.      The case was referred to the Court on 20 August 1991 by theGovernment of the Kingdom of Sweden ("the Government"), within thethree-month period laid down in Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47(art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention.  It originated in anapplication (no. 13441/87) against Sweden lodged with the EuropeanCommission of Human Rights ("the Commission") under Article 25(art. 25) by two Swedish citizens, Mr Stig and Mrs Gun Olsson,on 23 October 1987.         The object of the application was to obtain a decision as towhether or not the facts of the case disclosed a breach by therespondent State of its obligations under Article 8 (art. 8) of theConvention. 2.      In response to the enquiry made in accordance withRule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicants statedthat they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated thelawyer who would represent them (Rule 30). 3.      The Chamber to be constituted included ex officioMrs E. Palm, the elected judge of Swedish nationality (Article 43 ofthe Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of theCourt (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)).  On 28 September 1991 the Presidentdrew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of theseven other members, namely Mr F. Matscher, Mr L.-E. Pettiti,Mr B. Walsh, Mr C. Russo, Mr S.K. Martens, Mr A.N. Loizou andMr A.B. Baka (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21para. 4) (art. 43). 4.      Mr Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber(Rule 21 para. 5) and, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent ofthe Government, the Delegate of the Commission and therepresentative of the applicants on the organisation of theprocedure (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38).         In accordance with the orders made in consequence theregistry received, on 23 January 1992, the applicants' memorial and,on 6 February, the Government's.  On 6 April the Secretary to theCommission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit hisobservations at the hearing.         On 7 and 27 April the Commission filed a number of documentswhich the Registrar had sought from it on the President'sinstructions.  These included some, but not all, of the documentsrequested by the applicants. 5.      A number of documents were filed by the applicants and bythe Government on various dates between 3 February and15 April 1992. 6.      As further directed by the President, the hearing took placein public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on22 April 1992.  The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.         There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government     Mr C.H. Ehrenkrona, Legal Adviser,       Ministry for Foreign Affairs,                    Agent,    Mrs I.

The Court heard addresses by Mr Ehrenkrona for theGovernment, by Mr Gaukur Jörundsson for the Commission and byMrs Westerberg for the applicants, as well as replies to questionsput by the Court and by its President. AS TO THE FACTS I.      PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE     A.  Introduction 7.      The applicants, Mr Stig and Mrs Gun Olsson, who are husbandand wife, are Swedish citizens and live at Angered, near Gothenburgin Sweden.  There were three children of the marriage, namelyStefan, Helena and Thomas, born in June 1971, December 1976 andJanuary 1979, respectively. 8.      The present proceedings, which concern mainly Helena andThomas, are a sequel to the case which the Court decided in itsjudgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no. 130 (hereinafter referred toas "Olsson I").  That case concerned the period from16 September 1980, when the applicants' three children were takeninto public care, to 18 June 1987, when the public care of Helenaand Thomas was terminated (see paragraph 10 below).  The main issuein that case was whether the decision to take the children intocare, the manner in which it had been implemented and the refusalsto terminate the care had given rise to violations of Article 8(art. 8) of the Convention.  In the context of the case now underreview it is of importance to note that with regard to this issuethe Court held that "the implementation of the care decision, butnot that decision itself or its maintenance in force, gave rise to abreach of Article 8 (art. 8)" (Olsson I, p. 38, para. 84).         For the background to this case the Court refers in thefirst place to Part I of Olsson I (pp. 9-19, paras. 8-32).     B.  Proceedings relating to the applicants' requests for        termination of the public care order 9.      A first request by the applicants for termination of thepublic care order was dismissed by the Social District Council no. 6in Gothenburg ("the Social Council") on 1 June 1982.  The dismissalwas upheld by the County Administrative Court (länsrätten) on17 November and by the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten)in Gothenburg on 28 December 1982.  The applicants appliedunsuccessfully for leave to appeal to the Supreme AdministrativeCourt (regeringsrätten).         A fresh request, submitted to the Social Council in theautumn of 1983, was, according to the Government, rejected on6 December 1983.  Apparently, no appeal was lodged against thisdecision. 10.     A further request by the applicants for termination of thepublic care, apparently lodged on 16 August 1984, was rejected bythe Social Council on 30 October 1984 as far as concerns Helena andThomas and, after further investigations, on 17 September 1985 asregards Stefan. Appeals by the parents against these decisions weredismissed by the County Administrative Court on 3 October 1985 and3 February 1986, respectively, after it had obtained expert opinionsfrom Chief Doctors Per H. Jonsson and George Finney and from apsychologist, Mr Göran Löthman, on 22 and 30 August 1985 and held ahearing on 20 September 1985 in the former case.         The applicants thereupon appealed to the AdministrativeCourt of Appeal in Gothenburg, which joined the two cases.  On12 February 1986 the court decided to request an opinion from theCounty Administrative Board (länsstyrelsen), which it received on15 April 1986.  A hearing was scheduled for 21 August 1986 but waspostponed until 4 February 1987. After the hearing, at which theapplicants gave evidence, the court, by judgment of16 February 1987, directed that the public care of Stefan beterminated and dismissed the appeal in so far as it concerned Helenaand Thomas.         Following an appeal by the parents, the SupremeAdministrative Court, by judgment of 18 June 1987, directed that thepublic care of Helena and Thomas should terminate, there being nosufficiently serious circumstances to warrant its continuation.     C.  Prohibition on removal and related proceedings         1.      Decision to prohibit removal and refusal to suspend                its implementation 11.     In the above-mentioned proceedings, the SupremeAdministrative Court pointed out that the question to be determinedin deciding whether care should be discontinued pursuant tosection 5 of the 1980 Act (see the above-mentioned Olsson Ijudgment, pp. 25-26, para. 49) was whether there was still a needfor care.  The problems associated with the removal of a child froma foster home and its possible detrimental effects on him and withhis reunion with his natural parents were matters to be considerednot under section 5 but in separate proceedings, namely anexamination under section 28 of the Social Services Act 1980(socialtjänstlagen 1980: 620; see paragraph 57 below). 12.     On 23 June 1987 the Social Council prohibited, pursuant tosection 28 of the Social Services Act, the applicants from removingHelena and Thomas from their respective foster homes.  This decisionreferred, inter alia, to the two reports by Chief Doctors Jonssonand Finney (see paragraph 10 above).  The latter report noted thatThomas was no longer depressive but still had traits of a childhooddisturbance, in the form of delayed development and anguish inunfamiliar situations.         The Social Council's decision took account of the fact thatHelena and Thomas had not been under the care of the applicants fora long time, that the contacts between the parents and the childrenhad been very sparse and that the children had become emotionallyattached to their respective foster families and environment.Regard was also had to the fact that Thomas was showing signs ofgreater stability, that Helena had expressed a wish not to move andthat increased demands had been placed upon the natural parents byreason of Stefan's return to their home.  There was a risk, whichwas not of a minor nature, that if Helena and Thomas were to beremoved from their foster homes, their physical and mental healthwould thereby be harmed. 13.     On 25 June 1987 the County Administrative Court rejected arequest by the applicants for suspension (inhibition) of theprohibition order.  That decision was confirmed by theAdministrative Court of Appeal on 2 July 1987 and, on 17 August, theSupreme Administrative Court refused leave to appeal.         2.      First set of proceedings challenging the prohibition                on removal 14.     In the meantime, shortly after the decision of 23 June 1987to prohibit removal, the applicants had appealed against it to theCounty Administrative Court.  The court sought expert opinions fromChief Doctors Jonsson and Finney.  According to these opinions,dated 14 July and 3 September 1987, the prohibition was in Helena'sand Thomas's best interests because: (a)     Helena had shown signs of anxiety at the prospect of being        forced to return to her biological parents.  For instance,        on learning about the lifting of the public care order, she        had gone into hiding for two days; moreover, together with        Thomas, she had worked out escape plans in the event of a        return.  Whilst deriving a feeling of support from her        foster parents and friends, she felt extremely uncertain,        critical and hesitant about her natural parents.  Although        the latter had demanded her return, they had not, in her        view, indicated a willingness to form a relationship with        her and this confused her.  Removing Helena from her foster        home against her own wishes would entail a substantial risk        to her mental well-being and also to her physical health if,        in desperation, she were to carry out her plan of escaping        from the applicants' home; (b)     Thomas had suffered from certain childhood disturbances and        had a retarded development.  It was especially on the        emotional plane that he was handicapped; he was very        dependent upon his foster mother and was in a fragile phase        of his development.  To remove Thomas would have devastating        effects on his mental development, both emotionally and        intellectually.         Further, the psychologist Löthman, also considered, in anopinion supplied to the court on 3 September 1987, that remaining inthe foster home was in Thomas's best interests.  Mr Löthman observedthat Thomas had developed in a positive manner, although hecontinued to be psychologically vulnerable and to have greatemotional needs.  His attachment to the foster family had clearlybeen strong and positive; he had dismissed the idea, which gave riseto fear and anxiety on his part, of returning to his naturalparents.  In that event he intended to escape.         Both the Social Council and the guardian ad litem, Mr Åberg,recommended that the appeal be rejected.  The applicants did not askfor a hearing and the court did not hold one.  By judgment of3 November 1987, it dismissed the appeal. 15.     The applicants appealed to the Administrative Court ofAppeal, asking it to revoke the prohibition on removal or, in thealternative, to limit the measure in time, at the most until6 January 1988.  Again they did not ask for a hearing; the SocialCouncil and the guardian ad litem recommended that the appeal bedismissed.  The court examined the case on the basis of thecase-file and, by judgment of 30 December 1987, rejected the appeal. 16.     The applicants then proceeded with an appeal to the SupremeAdministrative Court, reiterating their request for revocation ofthe prohibition on removal or, in the alternative, for limitation ofthe measure in time, until 15 March 1988.  On this occasion theyasked for an oral hearing.         Leave to appeal was granted on 4 February 1988.  On the samedate the court requested the National Board of Health and Welfare(socialstyrelsen - "the Board") and the Social Council to submittheir opinions on the case, which they did on 22 and 23 March 1988,respectively.         Both opinions stressed the necessity of prohibiting removalof the children.  The Social Council intended, should the appeal bedismissed,  to ask for the custody of the children to be transferredto their respective foster parents.         The Board, for its part, pointed out that, having regard tothe long duration of the placement of the children in foster homesand to the limited contacts they had had, further contacts must bearranged under such conditions as would make the children feelsecure and would recognise their attachment to and feelings ofsecurity in the foster homes.  Referring to the child psychiatrists'and the psychologist's reports, the Board made mainly the sameobservations as those mentioned above (see paragraphs 12 and 14).It further noted, with regard to Thomas, that whilst it would taketime for a child of his character to build up confidence in adults,his foster mother had succeeded in creating an environment in whichhe could feel confident.  With regard to Helena, the Board alsostated that she had reached a phase of puberty and emancipation, thenormal course of which might be disturbed if she were forced toleave the foster home.         The Board further stressed that the relationship between thenatural parents and the children was of decisive importance for thequestion of removal where, as in this case, the children had beenplaced in foster homes for long periods of time.  In order to bringabout a good relationship, co-operation between - on the one hand -the applicants and - on the other hand - the social welfareauthorities and the foster parents was essential.  It appeared fromthe case-file that the applicants' lawyer had not sought to achievesuch co-operation, which was unfortunate for the children.  It hadhad the consequence that no such relationship had been establishedbetween the children and their parents as would make it possible forthe children to move to their parents without there being a seriousrisk of harm to the children.  The Board recommended that the SocialCouncil examine the possibility of having the custody of thechildren transferred to the foster parents. 17.     The Supreme Administrative Court rejected the applicants'request for a hearing.  With regard to the merits, in a judgment of30 May 1988 it dismissed their claim for revocation of theprohibition on removal; it accepted, on the other hand, that themeasure should be limited in time and modified the decision underappeal in such a way that the prohibition was to run until30 June 1989.  The judgment contained the following reasons:         "When section 28 ... is applied to this case a balance must        be struck between, on the one hand, respect for the        [applicants'] and their children's private and family life,        including the [applicants'] rights as guardians according to        the Parental Code, and, on the other hand, the need to        safeguard the children's health (see the third paragraph of        section 2 of Chapter 1 of the Instrument of Government        [regeringsformen] and sections 1 and 12 of the Social        Services Act; through these provisions the protection of        private and family life referred to in Article 8 (art. 8)        of the Convention ... can be ensured) ...         ... When [public] care is terminated according to section 5        of the 1980 Act reunion should normally take place as soon        as possible [and] ... needs to be prepared in an active and        competent manner.  Appropriate preparations should be made        immediately after the care has been terminated.  This should        be done even if a prohibition under section 28 ... has been        issued ... . The character and the extent of the        preparations, as well as the time required for them, depend        on the circumstances in each case; one or more suitably        arranged and successful visits by the children to their        parents' home must always be required. The need for a        prohibition on removal of a more permanent nature can        normally only be assessed after appropriate preparations        have been made.  It is the Social Council's responsibility        to arrange the ... preparations for reuniting parents and        children after the care has been terminated ... [This]        responsibility includes an obligation to try persistently to        make the parents and their lawyer participate, actively and        in the children's best interests, in the preparations.  The        Social Council is not discharged from its responsibility by        the mere fact that [they], by appealing against the        Council's decisions or in other ways, show that they dislike        measures taken by the Council or its staff.  According to        section 68 of the Social Services Act, the County        Administrative Board should assist the Council with advice        and ensure that the Council performs its tasks properly.         Pending the beginning and completion of appropriate        preparations for reunion of parents and children the        question of a more temporary prohibition on removal under        section 28 ... may also arise.  Such a prohibition should be        seen as a temporary measure until the child can be separated        from the foster home without any risk of harm as mentioned        in that provision.         ...         It appears from the examination of the present case that no        appropriate preparations have been made to reunite the        parents and the children.  Instead, the time which has        elapsed since the Supreme Administrative Court decided to        terminate the public care seems to have been spent on        litigation.         The issue whether a prohibition on removal under section 28        ... is needed in this case must therefore be examined        without taking account of the effect of preparations that        have been made.  The Supreme Administrative Court's decision        should thus concern the kind of temporary prohibition on        removal that, according to what has been stated above, can        be issued pending more appropriate preparatory measures.         From the examination - above all the opinion given by the        Board and the medical certificates it quotes - it appears        clearly that for the time being, before any preparations        have been made, there is a risk which is not of a minor        nature that Helena's and Thomas's physical and mental health        would be harmed were they to be separated from their foster        homes.  Accordingly, there are sufficient reasons for a        prohibition on removal under section 28 ...         As regards the duration of a prohibition on removal, the        Supreme Administrative Court has in a previous decision (see        Regeringsrättens Årsbok, RÅ 1984 2:78) stated inter alia the        following: if, when the prohibition is issued, it is already        possible to assess with sufficient certainty that there will        be no such risk after a specific date - when some measures        will have been taken or they will have had time to produce        effects -, the prohibition must run only until that date.        If, on the other hand, it is uncertain when the child could        be transferred to the parents without this involving a risk        which is not of a minor nature, the prohibition ought to        remain in force until further notice and the question of a        removal ought to be raised again at a later stage, when the        risk of harming the child's health can be better assessed.         An application of this rule to the present case would mean        that a prohibition on removal should remain in force until        further notice.  However, the circumstances of this case are        different from those of the previous case, as no appropriate        preparations have been made to reunite the parents and the        children, owing to the serious conflict between the Social        Council, on the one hand, and the parents and their lawyer,        on the other.  Furthermore it must be presumed in this case        that only a fixed time-limit might induce the parties        - without any further litigation - to co-operate in taking        appropriate preparatory steps in the children's interest.        If, within a certain time-limit, no such preparations have        been made or their result is unacceptable, the Social        Council may raise the question of a prolonged prohibition        based on the circumstances pertaining at that time.         Having regard to the foregoing, the Supreme Administrative        Court finds that the prohibition on removal should remain in        force until 30 June 1989.         The European Court of Human Rights has, in its judgment of        24 March 1988, found that Sweden violated Article 8 (art. 8)        of the Convention in one respect ... . This violation        concerned the implementation of the care decision and, inter        alia, the fact that the children were placed in foster homes        situated so far away from their parents.  The issue in this        case is another, namely when and on what conditions the        children can be reunited with their parents in view of the        termination of the care by the Supreme Administrative Court        on 18 June 1987. A prohibition on removal ... is therefore        not in conflict with the judgment of 24 March 1988."         3.      Request to return the children in accordance with                Chapter 21 of the Parental Code 18.     A request made by the applicants on 10 August 1987 thatHelena and Thomas be returned to them in accordance with section 7of Chapter 21 of the Parental Code (föräldrabalken; see paragraph 71below) had been rejected by the County Administrative Court ofGävleborg, after a hearing on 1 March 1988, by two separatejudgments of 15 March 1988.  The court had found that there was anot insignificant risk of harming the children's mental health byseparating them from the foster homes.         In a judgment of 11 July 1988 the Administrative Court ofAppeal dismissed the applicants' appeal.  On 23 September 1988 theSupreme Administrative Court refused them leave to appeal.         4.      Appointments of a guardian ad litem 19.     In connection with the above proceedings concerning theprohibition on removal, the District Court (tingsrätten) ofGothenburg, at the Social Council's request, had appointedMr Claes Åberg on 17 July 1987 as guardian ad litem for Helena andThomas (section 2 of Chapter 18 of the Parental Code).  Theappointment had not been notified to the applicants, who had notbeen heard on the matter; when their representative had learnedabout it, on 4 August, the time-limit for appealing against it hadexpired.         The applicants had asked the District Court to dismiss theguardian ad litem.  It had done so on 26 October, on the ground thatMr Åberg, by having applied for legal aid on the children's behalfto the County Administrative Court on 31 July, had accomplished thetask for which he had been appointed. 20.     On 27 October 1987 the Social Council had again asked theDistrict Court to appoint Mr Åberg as guardian ad litem.  On thisoccasion the court had invited the applicants to state their viewsbefore it took a decision.  It had granted the request on12 February 1988.         The applicants appealed to the Court of Appeal (hovrätten)for Western Sweden, which dismissed the appeal on 23 August 1988.On 8 November 1988 the Supreme Court (högsta domstolen) refused themleave to appeal.         5.      Second set of proceedings challenging the                prohibition on removal 21.     On 28 September 1988 the applicants made a fresh request tothe Social Council to lift the prohibition on removal, invoking - asa new circumstance - the Commission's opinion in the Eriksson v.Sweden case (annexed to the Court's judgment of 22 June 1989,Series A no. 156, pp. 38-55).  The request was rejected. 22.     In a judgment of 12 December 1988 the County AdministrativeCourt dismissed an appeal by the applicants against the SocialCouncil's decision.  The court, referring to the reasoning in theSupreme Administrative Court's judgment of 30 May 1988 (seeparagraph 17 above), pointed out that no appropriate preparatorymeasures for reunion as mentioned therein had been taken.  Itconsidered that there would still be a risk of harm to the childrenif the prohibition on removal were lifted. 23.     A further appeal by the applicants to the AdministrativeCourt of Appeal was rejected on 22 December 1988.  It noted thatMr Olsson had met the children on 11 and 12 October 1988 at theirrespective foster homes and schools and that the children hadvisited the applicants' home on 16 and 17 December, accompanied bythe foster parents.  The court found, nevertheless, for the reasonsexpressed in the County Administrative Court's judgment, that theprohibition should be maintained.         Leave to appeal was refused by the Supreme AdministrativeCourt on 14 February 1989.         6. Renewal of prohibition on removal and           related proceedings 24.     On 27 June 1989, a few days before the expiry of theprohibition on removal, the Social Council decided to renew it untilfurther notice.  Moreover, it refused a request by the applicantsthat the children spend their summer holidays with them in Alingsåsand visit them every weekend, unaccompanied by the foster parents(see paragraph 50 below). 25.     On appeal, the County Administrative Court, by judgment of4 September 1989, confirmed the prohibition on removal but decidedthat it was to run only until 31 March 1990.  The court again reliedon the reasoning in the Supreme Administrative Court's judgment of30 May 1988 and noted, moreover, that few measures had been taken inpreparation for removal.  It was highly unsatisfactory that, as longas two years after the termination of the public care, theconditions for executing that decision had not been fulfilled.  Thecourt considered that reasons still existed for maintaining theprohibition on removal and that, accordingly, the Swedish judiciaryand public authorities had failed in this respect.  Even though theapplicants and their lawyer had not contributed to a desirableextent to facilitating the children's reunion with their parents,the main responsibility for doing this lay with the Social Council,which, as stressed by the court, also had a duty to implementjudgments. 26.     Both the applicants and the Social Council appealed to theAdministrative Court of Appeal; the applicants sought to have theprohibition lifted, whereas the Social Council asked for it to bemaintained until further notice.  By judgment of 23 January 1990 thecourt confirmed the lower court's decision, but extended the time-limit for the prohibition until 1 August 1990.         The applicants were refused leave to appeal by the SupremeAdministrative Court on 8 March 1990.         7.      Further renewal of the prohibition on removal and                related proceedings 27.     The Social Council asked the County Administrative Court, on12 July 1990, to issue a new prohibition on removal, to be effectiveuntil further notice.  By judgment of 27 July 1990, the courtrenewed the prohibition until 28 February 1991.  It noted that nopreparatory measures with a view to reuniting the children and theparents had been taken; such measures were necessary in view of theatmosphere of hostility that existed between the parties to theproceedings, which was detrimental to Helena and Thomas.  There weretherefore good reasons to maintain the prohibition on removal.  Theneed for this measure was also shown by the fact that the questionof a transfer of the custody of the children to the foster parentswas scheduled for examination by the District Court in the autumn(see paragraphs 53-54 below).         The applicants lodged an appeal against this judgment withthe Administrative Court of Appeal.  They have apparently asked thecourt to stay the proceedings pending the final outcome of thoseconcerning the transfer of custody.     D.  The applicants' access to the children subsequent to the        entry into force of the prohibition on removal 28.     Prior to the termination of the public care of Helena andThomas on 18 June 1987, the applicants' contacts with the childrenhad been sparse.  Access had, since February 1983, been restrictedto one visit every third month in the foster homes.  However, nosuch visits occurred during the period from June 1984 until April1987, when Mr Olsson and the elder son Stefan visited them (forfurther details, see the above-mentioned Olsson I judgment,pp. 15-16, paras. 21, 24-26).  It does not appear that any formaldecision with regard to access was taken in connection with thedecision of 23 June 1987 to prohibit the applicants from removingHelena and Thomas from the foster homes.         1.      Particulars concerning the applicants' access to                Helena and Thomas 29.     Since the prohibition on removal was imposed on23 June 1987, the following meetings have taken place between theapplicants and Helena and Thomas: (a)     22 July 1988: a meeting of a few hours in a park in        Gothenburg, the children being accompanied by one of the        foster parents; (b)     11 and 12 October 1988: visits by Mr Olsson in the foster        homes; (c)     16 and 17 December 1988: visits by the children, accompanied        by the foster mothers, in the applicants' home, the night        being spent in a hotel; (d)     8 and 9 April 1989: visits by the applicants in the foster        homes; (e)     16 and 17 June 1989: visits by the children, accompanied by        the foster mothers, in the applicants' home, the night being        spent in a hotel.         2. Access claims and related proceedings 30.     Shortly after the decision of 23 June 1987 to prohibitremoval, the applicants, through their lawyer, asked the socialwelfare authorities to arrange for Helena and Thomas to visit themin their home in Gothenburg.  By letter of 27 October 1987 from thesocial welfare officer, they were advised that they should firstvisit the children so that they could get to know them better andprepare for a visit by the children in Gothenburg together with thefoster parents.  Subject to prior consultation with the fosterparents, the applicants were free to decide on the furtherarrangements for visits in the foster homes.  Finally, the letterindicated a possibility of refunding travel and subsistence expensesincurred by the applicants in connection with their visits.         Throughout the autumn of 1987, there was an exchange ofletters between the applicants' lawyer and the social welfareauthorities - mainly the Chief District Officer - on the question ofaccess.  Whilst the applicants insisted that the children visit themwithout the foster parents, the Chief District Officer, referring tothe justifications for the prohibition on removal, maintained thatsince Mrs Olsson had not met the children since 1984, bothapplicants should first visit them in their respective foster homeenvironment.  Moreover, in the event of a visit by the children inthe applicants' home, at least one of the foster parents should bepresent. 31.     On 18 December 1987 the Chairman of the Social Councilrefused a request by the applicants to visit Helena and Thomaswithout the foster parents being present.  She found no reason toamend the Chief District Officer's decision on the matter.  On21 December the Social Council was informed of the refusal; itdecided to take note of it but did not take any specific measures. 32.     The applicants appealed against the Chairman's decision tothe County Administrative Court, asking it to confer on them a rightof access as requested.  In a decision of 8 March 1988, the courtfound that it was not possible to appeal, under section 73 of theSocial Services Act (see paragraph 60 below), against measuresprescribed by the Social Council as to the manner, time and place ofaccess and refused the appeal.         On 29 April 1988 the Administrative Court of Appeal upheldthat judgment, noting that the Chairman's decision had not beentaken under section 28 of that Act and did not fall into any othercategory of measures which could be appealed against pursuant tosection 73. 33.     The applicants then proceeded with an appeal to the SupremeAdministrative Court, alleging that the Chairman's decision of18 December 1987 was unlawful and that the absence of a right ofappeal against it constituted a violation of Article 13 (art. 13)of the Convention.  The court granted leave to appeal and, in adecision (beslut) of 18 July 1988, refused the appeal.  It stated:         "Under section 16 of the [1980 Act] ..., a Social Council        may restrict the right of access in respect of children        taken into public care under this Act.  As regards the right        of access to children while a prohibition on removal is in        force, no similar power has been vested in the Social        Council in the relevant legislation.  As there is no legal        provision empowering the Social Council to restrict the        right of access while the prohibition on removal is in force        ..., the instructions given by the Chairman of the Social        Council in order to limit the right of access have no legal        effect.  Nor can any right of appeal be inferred from        general principles of administrative law or from the        European Convention on Human Rights." 34.     On 15 August 1988 the applicants lodged a municipal appeal(kommunalbesvär; see paragraph 63 below) with the AdministrativeCourt of Appeal against the Chairman's decision of 18 December 1987.The court found that that decision could not form the object of amunicipal appeal and that, in so far as the appeal might beconsidered as directed against the Social Council's failure to takeany specific measures when informed of the decision (seeparagraph 31 above), it was out of time.  The appeal was thusdismissed on 10 October 1988. 35.     In the meantime, on 21 March and 11 April 1988, the socialwelfare authorities had rejected requests by the applicants' lawyerthat Helena and Thomas be allowed to attend their grandmother'sfuneral and a special burial ceremony and, in this connection, stayfor one night at the applicants' home.  The social welfareauthorities had pointed, inter alia, to the fact that the childrenhardly knew their grandmother and to the need to arrange contacts inan environment in which the children could feel safe and confident. 36.     In June and July 1988 the social welfare officer contactedthe applicants and arranged for talks involving Mr Olsson and thefoster parents, to plan the meeting which took place in Gothenburgon 22 July 1988 (see paragraph 29 above).  Mrs Olsson did notparticipate in these preparations, as she insisted on having accesson her own terms.  However, as suggested by the social welfareofficer, Helena's foster mother was invited to the applicants' homeafter a preparatory meeting.  On one occasion the officer askedMr Olsson for his and his wife's telephone number in order tofacilitate contacts, but he declined to give it.         After the meeting on 22 July 1988, Mr Olsson told the socialwelfare authorities that he had been disappointed; he had felt thathe was being watched and controlled and Helena had called her fostermother "mummy". 37.     On 8 August 1988 the social welfare authorities dismissed arequest made by the applicants on 2 August that Helena and Thomas beallowed to join them - on 5 August or at the latest on 8 August -for the rest of the summer holidays, on the ground that meetingsshould be arranged in such a way as not to jeopardise the children'shealth and development. 38.     On 11 August 1988 the applicants' lawyer demanded that thechildren be permitted to visit them every weekend and school holidayuntil 30 June 1989.  At a meeting with two social welfare officerson 17 August 1988, Mr Olsson showed understanding of the view thatsuch visits were not appropriate and stated that he would recommenda "soft line" in the efforts to bring about suitable access.  On hissuggestion, the next meetings were planned to take place in thefoster homes in October.  On 18 August the Social Council rejectedthe request of 11 August. 39.     On 19 August 1988 the applicants' lawyer reiterated therequest for access at weekends.  In reply, the social welfareofficer informed her of the discussion with Mr Olsson on 17 August(see paragraph 38 above).  A few days later, Mr Olsson told socialwelfare officers that he was dissatisfied, on account of theirattempts to delay access as much as possible.  They reminded himthat he had himself proposed that the next meeting with the childrenshould be in October.  The meetings were held on 11 and12 October 1988 (see paragraph 29 above).  On this occasion thesocial welfare authorities booked and paid for air tickets and hotelrooms for two persons, but Mrs Olsson declined to go.         3.      Access plan 40.     On 7 December 1988 the Chief District Officer recommended anaccess plan to the Social Council.  The recommendation referred,inter alia, to two expert opinions, one by Chief Doctor Jonsson andanother by Chief Doctor Finney and the psychologist, Mr Löthman,dated 10 and 12 October 1988, dealing specifically with the questionof access.  The former noted, with respect to Helena, that it wasimportant to place emphasis on her own wishes, to improve herpossibilities of knowing about her natural parents and to arrangethe access in a manner which would make it an everyday event; sheshould meet the applicants together with the foster parents.  Thelatter opinion stressed, with regard to Thomas, that access shouldbe resumed only if he so wished to which end certain preparatorymeasures aimed at motivating him should be made - and only ifmeetings were attended by the foster parents.  It was essential thatthe natural parents and the foster parents co-operate in the child'sbest interests.         The plan envisaged access as follows: (a)     on 16 and 17 December 1988: visit by the children,accompanied by the foster mothers, in the applicants' home; if thiswas successful: (b)     visit by the applicants in the foster homes over two days inFebruary 1989; if this went well: (c)     visit by the applicants to Thomas in his foster home and toHelena, if she so wishes, in April 1989; again, if this went well: (d)     visit similar to that mentioned at (a), to be organised overa few days in June 1989 with a possibility of letting the childrenchoose to spend the night at the applicants' home rather than at ahotel, provided that the foster mother accompany them; (e)     in addition to the above, the applicants should be able toarrange visits by agreement with the foster parents. 41.     The applicants met Helena and Thomas as envisaged at (a)and, on 20 December 1988, the Social Council adopted the plan.  Itwas communicated to the applicants and their lawyer for comments,but they objected to it.         4. Further access claims 42.     During 1989 and 1990 the applicants, through their lawyer,continued to make a large number of requests for access; inparticular, they demanded that the children visit them duringweekends at their own home and without the foster parents beingpresent.         Several of these requests were refused by the social welfareauthorities for such reasons as the children being opposed tovisiting the parents and wishing to be visited by them instead(letters of 27 September 1989 and 7 February 1990) or too shortnotice having been given to organise the visits (letters of 28 Marchand 13 September 1989) or indications by Mr Olsson that he wouldgive the children a certain period to reflect on the matter duringwhich he would not claim access (letter of 11 October 1989).         Moreover, the social welfare authorities dismissed on21 April and 26 May 1989 requests that Helena and Thomas attend thebirthday celebrations of their grandfather and their brother Stefan.In the former case, regard was had to the fact that Helena did notwish to go and, in the latter case, to the fact that the date inquestion was inconvenient, being the last day of the school year.         Furthermore, on 21 March 1989 the Social Council refusedaccess for the purposes of a medical examination, which theapplicants had requested in order to obtain a medical certificate tobe used in the proceedings before the Commission.  The decision wasbased on an opinion by the Board that further examination of thechildren might be harmful to them and would be of no assistance inthose proceedings. 43.     In a report of 30 May 1989 to the social welfareauthorities, Chief Doctor Finney recommended that access shouldcontinue to some extent between the applicants and Thomas and shouldbe arranged in his foster home, not in the applicants' home.  Asimilar view was expressed by the psychologist, Mr Löthman, in hisreport of the same date.  According to a report of 13 June suppliedby Chief Doctor Jonsson to the social authorities, Helena found thattravelling to the applicants' home was a trying experience andpreferred being visited by them.  In his view, contacts served tofulfil her need to be kept informed about the applicants.         The Chief District Officer, in a report of 15 June 1989,made the following assessment of the question of access.  Havingregard to the fact that visits by the children in the applicants'home would not only conflict with expert opinions but were also notwelcomed by the children, access arrangements should primarilyconsist of the parents visiting the children in the foster homes.However, should the children express an interest in visiting theapplicants, the social welfare authorities would assist in arrangingsuch contacts.  In the light of these considerations, the ChiefDistrict Officer adopted a plan for visits by the parents in Augustand October 1989 and then by the children in December 1989.  Theapplicants were invited to contact the social welfare authorities onthe matter, but did not do so.  The reason for this, as laterexplained by Mr Olsson, was that on a previous occasion he had notbeen received properly by the social welfare officer responsible fortheir case. 44.     By letter of 16 November 1989, the applicants again askedfor the children to be allowed to visit them every weekend; theyalso sought permission, firstly, for themselves and their son Stefanto visit the children in one of the foster homes without the fosterparents being present and, secondly, for their lawyer to meet Helenaand Thomas to inform them of the applicants' and Stefan's situationand to explain to them why they had been taken into public care andwhy the applicants did not wish to visit them in the foster homes inthe foster parents' presence.         The Head of the Social Service (socialförvaltningen) inGothenburg replied by letter of 20 November 1989 that the socialwelfare officer would contact them as soon as possible with a viewto making a suitable arrangement for their next meeting with thechildren. 45.     On 21 November 1989 the social welfare authorities receiveda letter from the applicants' lawyer reiterating the claims of16 November.  A further letter was received on 22 December,requesting access to the children in one of the foster homes in theabsence of the foster parents.  In reply to the latter, the socialwelfare authorities informed the lawyer on 27 December that theywould contact the foster parents directly on the matter. 46.     On 21 December 1989 the applicants had reported the officerin charge of their case to the Public Prosecution Authority(åklagarmyndigheten) of Gothenburg for misuse of power and asked forher immediate arrest.  The reason for this action was her failure tocomply with their request of 16 November 1989.  On 30 January 1990the Public Prosecution Authority discontinued the criminalinvestigation, finding no indication that a criminal offence hadbeen committed. 47.     In a letter dated 25 January 1990, the social welfareauthorities invited the applicants to talks in order to find asolution to the problem of access but, by letter received on1 February from the applicants' lawyer, they were advised that suchtalks would serve no purpose. 48.     In response to letters from the applicants' lawyer, dated13 February and 2 March 1990 and mainly reiterating their requestsmade in November and December 1989, the social welfare authorities,by letter of 8 March, pointed out that they were not opposed tomeetings; they invited the applicants to contact the foster parentsto make arrangements, failing which the applicants would becontacted by the latter. 49.     On 14 May 1990 the applicants' lawyer demanded that thechildren be left to be met by the parents at Gothenburg airport oncertain specified dates and, on 5 June, she requested that this bearranged every weekend.  In the meantime, on 17 May, the socialwelfare authorities had replied that Thomas's foster mother wouldwrite to them and had also asked the applicants to contact thefoster parents by telephone, as the former had a secret telephonenumber.  On 6 June the lawyer asked the Social Council to grant- immediately after 1 July (the date of the entry into force of the1990 Act; see paragraphs 64 and 67 below) - access every weekend atthe applicants' own home and in the absence of the foster parents.         In this connection, the Chief District Officer submitted tothe Social Council a report, dated 2 July 1990, making observationssimilar to those in her report of 15 June 1989 (see paragraph 43above) and recommending that the request be dismissed.  The reportnoted, inter alia, that since the meeting in June 1989, the childrenhad become strongly opposed to visiting their parents but were opento being visited by them.  The applicants' demands as to the formsof access had had the effect of increasing the gap between them andthe children.         On 4 September 1990 the Social Council dismissed theapplicants' request for access every weekend at their own home,finding that access should instead take place in the foster homes inconformity with the children's wishes.         5.      Further proceedings concerning access 50.     The applicants' lawyer, in her capacity as a member of themunicipality of Gothenburg, filed two municipal appeals (seeparagraph 63 below) with the Administrative Court of Appeal: one wasagainst the Social Council's decision of 27 June 1989 (seeparagraph 24 above) in so far as it concerned access and the otheragainst its decision of 20 December 1988 adopting an access plan(see paragraphs 40-41 above).         With regard to the first appeal, the court found, byjudgment of 8 January 1990, that the contested part of the SocialCouncil's decision of 27 June 1989 was unlawful and annulled it.         As to the second appeal, the court held, in another judgmentof the same date, that the adoption of the plan formed part of themeasures considered necessary by the Social Council in order topermit removal of the children without there being any risk of harmto them.  The plan was not a formal decision on the applicants'right of access, especially since it provided that they could visitthe children in accordance with the latter's wishes.         On 8 March and 27 December 1990, respectively, the SupremeAdministrative Court refused the applicants' lawyer leave to appealagainst the second judgment and the Social Council leave to appealagainst the first. 51.     Moreover, on 28 July 1989 the applicants complained to theParliamentary Ombudsman (justitieombudsmannen) who, in an opinion of2 May 1990, stated, inter alia, that it appeared from theexamination of the case that the Social Council had acted solely outof consideration for the children.  In view of this fact and of thelacunae in the Social Services Act 1980 on the question ofregulation of access (see paragraph 62 below) - which had led tolegislative amendments in 1990 (see paragraphs 64 and 67 below) -,she declared the matter closed. 52.     The applicants also lodged an appeal with the CountyAdministrative Court against the Social Council's decision of4 September 1990 (see paragraph 49 above).  It was dismissed byjudgment of 12 December 1990.  The court found that the applicants'allegation that the foster parents had influenced the childrenagainst their natural parents was not borne out by theinvestigations in the case; on the contrary, they showed that thechildren wished to meet their parents, albeit on their terms.Moreover, the sort of access requested did not take the children'sinterests into account and would not benefit them.  There wastherefore no ground for allowing access during weekends, asrequested by the applicants.  The court did not examine their claimfor access during school holidays as this had not been dealt with bythe Social Council.         The applicants further appealed to the Administrative Courtof Appeal.  They appear to have asked the court to keep their appealin abeyance pending the outcome of the transfer of custodyproceedings (see paragraphs 53-54 below).         E.      Transfer of custody 53.     Although the present judgment is not concerned with thequestion of transfer of custody, the decisions by the Swedishauthorities on the matter are described below in so far as they mayshed light on the case.         The Social Council decided on 31 October 1989 to instituteproceedings in the District Court of Alingsås for a transfer of thecustody of Helena and Thomas to their respective foster parents.After holding a preliminary hearing on 27 February 1990, the court,by judgment of 24 January 1991, transferred the custody.  It orderedthat the applicants should each year receive three day-time visitsfrom the children at their home and be able to visit them at thefoster homes for three weekends. 54.     The applicants appealed against the District Court'sjudgment to the Court of Appeal for Western Sweden.  The latter helda hearing at which it took evidence from two welfare officers whohad been responsible for the case, the children's respective fosterparents, Chief Doctors Jonsson and Finney, as well as Helena and acontact person (kontaktman) of hers within the social services.  Theapplicants maintained, inter alia, that the foster parents wereunsuited as custodians.  In particular, they contended that they hadlearned after the District Court judgment that Helena's fosterfather, Mr Larsson, had been charged in 1986-87 with assault,including sexual assault, and sexual exploitation of a minor, namelyanother foster girl called "Birgitta".  Mr Larsson had beenacquitted by Hudiksvall District Court due to lack of evidence.However, he had stated during the police investigations that he hadacted in a manner which, according to the applicants, constitutedsexual assault, although it had not been covered by the charges.The public prosecutor had appealed against the acquittal but hadsubsequently withdrawn the appeal.         By judgment of 24 January 1992, the Court of Appeal upheldthe Alingsås District Court's judgment.  It stated, inter alia,that, having regard to Helena's and Thomas's age and degree ofmaturity, great importance should be attached to their views aboutthe questions of custody and access.  It was clear that they bothwanted to remain in their foster homes.  Moreover, contacts betweenthe applicants and the children had been very infrequent, especiallyin recent years.  According to the applicants, they had beenprevented from exercising their right of access partly because theyhad previously felt unwelcome and been badly treated by the fosterparents, and partly because the social welfare authorities had beenopposed to providing financial assistance for journeys to meet thechildren.  However, these allegations were refuted by the socialwelfare officers and the foster parents.  In the view of the Courtof Appeal, the absence of contacts was due rather to lack of desireand initiative on the part of the applicants to visit the children.In addition, the applicants had kept their telephone number secret.         The claim that the foster parents were unsuited ascustodians was mainly directed against Helena's foster father,Mr Larsson.  The court found that when giving evidence before it, hehad left an impression of reliability and honesty, despite the factthat he must have been under pressure due to his wife's illness andthe manner in which he was questioned by the applicants' lawyer.Further, the court observed that the conditions in the Larssons'home had been examined carefully on a number of occasions during therelevant period; Helena had good contacts with people in herenvironment and had since recently had a contact person who had beenheard by the court; moreover, she had visited the applicants on herown in March 1991: on no occasion had she said that she had beenassaulted by Mr Larsson or shown any sign to this effect.  At thehearing before the court, she had emphatically denied that he hadbehaved improperly towards her.  The court found that there was noevidence to support the allegation that Helena had been, or ran arisk of being, a victim of improper conduct on the part ofMr Larsson.  As regards Mrs Larsson's illness, the Court of Appealnoted that she spent most of her time at home and that bothMr Larsson's and Helena's statements indicated that the emotionalties between Helena and Mrs Larsson had been strengthened, ratherthan weakened, since she became ill.  The illness could thus notconstitute an obstacle to the transfer of custody.  Finally, theinvestigations provided no evidence to suggest that Thomas's fosterparents, Mr and Mrs Bäckius, were unsuited.  On the contrary, whatemerged in the proceedings was that both children were well caredfor in the foster homes, in a secure and stimulating environment.         A further appeal by the applicants to the Supreme Court iscurrently pending. II.     RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW     A.  The Child Welfare Act 1960 and the 1980 legislation        replacing it 55.     Decisions concerning the applicants' children were based onthe Child Welfare Act 1960 (barnavårdslagen 1960:97 - "the 1960Act"), the Social Services Act 1980 (socialtjänstlagen 1980:620) andthe 1980 Act containing Special Provisions on the Care of YoungPersons (lagen 1980: 621 med särskilda bestämmelser om vård av unga- "the 1980 Act").         The Social Services Act 1980 contains provisions regardingsupportive and preventive measures effected with the approval of theindividuals concerned.  The 1980 Act (1980:621), which provided forcompulsory care measures, complemented the Social Services Act 1980;when they entered into force on 1 January 1982, they replaced the1960 Act.  In general, decisions taken under the 1960 Act, whichwere still in force on 31 December 1981, were considered to havebeen taken under the 1980 Act.  As from 1 July 1990 the relevantlegislation has been amended (see paragraphs 64-67 below). 56.     It is primarily the responsibility of the municipalities topromote a positive development for the young.  For this purpose eachmunicipality has a Social Council, composed of lay members assistedby a staff of professional social workers.         1. Prohibition on removal 57.     The Social Council could, after the termination of publiccare (for details of the Swedish law on compulsory care, see theOlsson I judgment, pp. 20-27, paras. 35-50), issue a prohibition onremoval under section 28 of the Social Services Act, which read asfollows:         "The Social Council may for a certain period of time or        until further notice prohibit the guardian of a minor from        taking the minor from a home referred to in section 25 [i.e.        a foster home], if there is a risk, which is not of a minor        nature, of harming the child's physical or mental health if        separated from that home.         If there are reasonable grounds to assume that there is such        a risk, although the necessary investigations have not been        completed, a temporary prohibition may be issued for a        maximum period of four weeks, pending the final decision in        the matter.         A prohibition issued under this section does not prevent a        removal of the child from the home on the basis of a        decision under Chapter 21 of the Parental Code."         The preparatory work (Prop. 1979/80:1, p. 541) relevant tothis provision mentioned that a purely passing disturbance or otheroccasional disadvantage to the child was not sufficient ground forissuing a prohibition on removal.  It stated that the factors to beconsidered when deciding whether or not to issue such a prohibitionincluded the child's age, degree of development, character,emotional ties and present and prospective living conditions, aswell as the time he had been cared for away from the parents and hiscontacts with them while separated.  If the child had reached theage of 15, his own preference should not be opposed without goodreasons; if he was younger, it was still an important factor to betaken into account.         The Standing Social Committee of the Parliament stated inits report (Socialutskottets betänkande 1979/80:44, p. 78), interalia, that a prohibition might be issued if removal could involve arisk of harm to the child's physical or mental health, thus evenwhere no serious objections existed in regard to the guardian.  TheCommittee also stressed that the provision was aimed at safeguardingthe best interests of the child and that those interests mustprevail whenever they conflicted with the guardian's interest indeciding the domicile of the child.  It also took as its point ofdeparture the assumption that a separation generally involved a riskof harm to the child.  Repeated transfers and transfers which tookplace after a long time, when the child had developed strong linkswith the foster home, should thus not be accepted without goodreasons: the child's need for secure relations and living conditionsshould be decisive. 58.     According to the case-law of the Supreme AdministrativeCourt (RÅ 1984 2:78), while a prohibition on removal is in force,the Social Council is under a duty to ensure that appropriatemeasures aimed at reuniting parents and child are taken withoutdelay. 59.     Section 28 of the Social Services Act did not apply tochildren who were being cared for in foster homes under section 1 ofthe 1980 Act.  As long as such care continued, the right of theguardian to determine the domicile of the child was suspended.Whilst that right in principle revived on the termination of suchcare, it could be further suspended by an application of section 28by the social welfare authorities. 60.     Under section 73 of the Social Services Act, a decisiontaken under section 28 could be appealed to the administrativecourts.  In practice, besides the natural parents both the childconcerned and the foster parents have been allowed to lodge suchappeals.  In the proceedings before the administrative courts, aspecial guardian may be appointed to protect the interests of thechild, should these come into conflict with those of the child'slegal guardian.         2. Regulation of access 61.     While a child was in public care under the 1980 Act, theSocial Council was empowered to impose restrictions on the parents'right of access to him, in so far as necessary for the purposes ofthe care decision (section 16).  Such restrictions could be appealedagainst to the administrative courts by both the parents and thechild. 62.     The legal position concerning restrictions on access duringa prohibition on removal was different.  As held by the SupremeAdministrative Court on 18 July 1988, a decision by the SocialCouncil to restrict the access rights of Mr and Mrs Olsson - whowere the appellants in that case - while a prohibition on removalunder section 28 of the Social Services Act was in force had nolegal effect and no appeal to the administrative courts would lieagainst such a decision (see paragraph 33 above).         3. Municipal appeal 63.     Pursuant to sections 1 and 2 of Chapter 7 of the 1977Municipal Act (kommunallagen 1977:179), a member (medlem, e.g. aresident) of a municipality may lodge a municipal appeal(kommunalbesvär) with the Administrative Court of Appeal againstdecisions by municipalities on the following grounds: failure toobserve the statutory procedures, infringement of the law, ultravires conduct, violation of the complainant's own rights, or otherunfairness.  The appeal has to be filed within three weeks from thedate on which approval of the minutes of the decision has beenannounced on the municipal notice-board.  If the court upholds theappeal, it may quash the decision, but not give a new decision.     B.  New legislation 64.     The provisions of the Social Services Act which related to aprohibition on removal are now contained, in amended form, in the1990 Act with Special Provisions on the Care of Young Persons (lagen1990:52 med särskilda bestämmelser om vård av unga - "the 1990Act").  This entered into force on 1 July 1990. 65.     Section 24 of the 1990 Act, which corresponds to theprevious section 28 of the Social Services Act (see paragraph 57above), provides that the County Administrative Court may, onapplication by the Social Council, impose a prohibition on removalfor a certain time or until further notice.  The condition for sucha prohibition is that there must be         "an apparent risk (påtaglig risk) that the young person's        health and development will be harmed if he is separated        from the home".         Although this wording differs from that of section 28 of the1980 Act, it was not intended, according to the preparatory work(Prop. 1989/90:28, p. 83), to introduce a new standard. 66.     According to section 26 of the 1990 Act, the Social Councilshall, at least once every three months, consider whether aprohibition on removal is still necessary.  If it is not, it shalllift the prohibition. 67.     Pursuant to section 31, the Social Council may decide toregulate the parents' access to the child if it is necessary in viewof the purposes of the prohibition on removal.  Such decisions may,under section 41, be appealed against to the administrative courts.     C.  The Parental Code 68.     Chapter 21 of the Parental Code deals with the enforcementof judgments or decisions regarding custody and other relatedmatters. 69.     Section 1 specifies that actions for the enforcement ofjudgments or decisions by the ordinary courts concerning the custodyor surrender of children or access to them are to be institutedbefore the County Administrative Court. 70.     According to section 5, enforcement may not take placeagainst the will of a child who has reached the age of 12 unless theCounty Administrative Court finds enforcement to be necessary in thechild's best interests. 71.     Under section 7, if the child is staying with someone otherthan the person entitled to custody, the child's custodian may, evenwhen no judgment or decision as described in section 1 exists, seekfrom the County Administrative Court an order for the transfer ofthe child to him.  Such an order may be refused if the bestinterests of the child require that the question of custody beexamined by the ordinary courts.         When taking decisions under this section, the CountyAdministrative Court shall also observe the requirements laid downin section 5 (see paragraph 70 above). PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION 72.     In their application of 23 October 1987 to the Commission(no. 13441/87), Mr and Mrs Olsson alleged a series of violations ofArticle 8 (art. 8) of the Convention on the ground, inter alia, thatthe Swedish social welfare authorities had hindered their reunionwith Helena and Thomas and had prevented the applicants from havingaccess to them.  They also complained of a number of breaches ofArticle 6 (art. 6) and, in addition, invoked Articles 13 and 53(art. 13, art. 53). 73.     On 7 May 1990 the Commission declared the applicationadmissible.         In its report dated 17 April 1991 (Article 31) (art. 31),the Commission expressed the opinion:         (a)     unanimously, that there had been a violation of        Article 8 (art. 8) on the ground that the restrictions on        access were not "in accordance with the law";         (b)     by seventeen votes to three, that there had been a        violation of Article 8 (art. 8) with regard to the        prohibition on removal;         (c)     unanimously, that there had been a violation of        Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) on the ground that the        applicants did not have access to court to challenge the        restrictions on access to the children;         (d)     by fourteen votes to six, that there had been no        violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) as a result of the        duration of the proceedings concerning the termination of        the public care of Stefan, Helena and Thomas;         (e)     by nineteen votes to one, that there had been no        violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) with regard to the        duration of the proceedings under Chapter 21 of the Parental        Code;         (f)     by nineteen votes to one, that there had been no        violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) on the ground that        the Supreme Administrative Court did not hold a hearing on        the applicants' appeal concerning the prohibition on        removal;         (g)     unanimously, that there had been no violation of        Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) in relation to the first        appointment of a guardian ad litem;         (h)     unanimously, that there had been no violation of        Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) as a result of the duration of        the proceedings relating to the second appointment of a        guardian ad litem;         (i)     unanimously, that it was not necessary to examine        whether there had been a violation of Article 13 (art. 13)        in respect of the restrictions on access;         (j)     unanimously, that there had been no violation of        Article 13 (art. 13) in respect of the first appointment of        a guardian ad litem.         The full text of the Commission's opinion and the dissentingopinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to thepresent judgment*. _______________* Note by the Registrar: for practical reasons this annex willappear only with the printed version of the judgment (volume 250 ofSeries A of the Publications of the Court), but a copy of theCommission's report is available from the registry._______________ FINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT BY THE GOVERNMENT 74.     At the hearing on 22 April 1992, the Government confirmedthe final submission in their memorial admitting violations of theConvention in that, for a certain period, the restrictions on accessdecided by the Social Council were not "in accordance with the law"and that the applicants had not had a court remedy in respect ofthose restrictions.  On the other hand, they invited the Court tohold that there had been no violation of the Convention in thepresent case other than those admitted by them. AS TO THE LAW I.      SCOPE OF THE CASE BEFORE THE COURT 75.     The present application of 23 October 1987, as declaredadmissible by the Commission, raised a series of complaints as to(1) the prohibition on removal, its maintenance in force and therestrictions on the applicants' access to the children while theprohibition was in force; (2) the length of certain specificdomestic proceedings and the lack of a hearing on appeal; and (3)alleged violations of the right of access to a court or to aneffective remedy with respect to certain decisions (see theCommission's decision on admissibility, under the heading"Complaints", and paragraphs 95 and 176-185 of its report).         In their subsequent pleadings, the applicants appeared toraise a number of further complaints relating to (a) the decision totransfer custody of Helena and Thomas to their respective fosterparents (see paragraphs 53-54 above); (b) the independence andimpartiality of the courts which made or upheld this decision; and(c) the total length of the national proceedings (which had startedin 1980 and were not yet terminated).         These new complaints were, however, not covered by theCommission's decision on admissibility.  It is true that, on certainconditions, the rule that the scope of the Court's jurisdiction isdetermined by the Commission's admissibility decision may be subjectto qualifications (see, inter alia, the Olsson I judgment, p. 28,para. 56), but the complaints in question do not meet thoseconditions.  The Court therefore has no jurisdiction to entertainthem.         Accordingly, it will not go into the applicants'circumstantial allegations before the Court to the effect that thefoster parents of Helena and Thomas were for various reasonsunsuited as carers.  The Court presumes, as the Government evidentlydid, that these allegations were made solely in support of thecomplaints made by the applicants in respect of the transfer ofcustody proceedings.  The Court notes, however, that the allegationswere rejected after careful examination by the Court of Appeal forWestern Sweden in those proceedings (see paragraph 54 above). II.     ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 8 (art. 8) OF THE CONVENTION     A.  Introduction 76.     The applicants' complaints under Article 8 (art. 8) of theConvention concerned the period from 18 June 1987, when the publiccare of Helena and Thomas was terminated (see paragraph 10 above),to 24 January 1991, when the custody of these children wastransferred to their respective foster parents (see paragraphs 53-54above).  The applicants contended that the prohibition on removal,its maintenance in force and the restrictions on access had givenrise to breaches of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, whichprovides as follows:         "1.     Everyone has the right to respect for his private        and family life, his home and his correspondence.         2.      There shall be no interference by a public authority        with the exercise of this right except such as is in        accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic        society in the interests of national security, public safety        or the economic well-being of the country, for the        prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of        health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and        freedoms of others."         The Government admitted that there had been a violation ofArticle 8 (art. 8) in that until 1 July 1990 the restrictions onaccess had no basis in domestic law, but otherwise contested theapplicants' allegations.  The Commission reached a correspondingconclusion with respect to the restrictions on access, but alsoexpressed the opinion that the maintenance in force of theprohibition on removal, without any meaningful contact between theapplicants and their children being established and without anyother effective measure to resolve the existing problems,constituted a violation of Article 8 (art. 8).     B.  Was there an interference with the applicants' right to        respect for family life? 77.     The prohibition on removal and its maintenance in force, aswell as the restrictions on access, clearly constituted, and thiswas not disputed, interferences with the applicants' right torespect for family life (see, amongst other authorities, the above-mentioned Eriksson judgment, Series A no. 156, p. 24, para. 58).         Such interference entails a violation of Article 8 (art. 8)unless it is "in accordance with the law", has an aim or aims thatis or are legitimate under Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2) and is"necessary in a democratic society" for the aforesaid aim or aims(ibid.).     C.  Were the interferences justified?         1. "In accordance with the law" 78.     In the applicants' submission, the measures taken by theSwedish authorities had, contrary to Swedish law, been intended toprevent them from being reunited with Helena and Thomas and fromhaving appropriate access to them.  On the other hand, theapplicants did not seem to question the lawfulness of accessrestrictions imposed after the entry into force of the 1990 Act on1 July 1990 (see paragraph 67 above).                 (a) Prohibition on removal 79.     The Court observes that the prohibition on removal and itsmaintenance in force were based until July 1990 on section 28 of theSocial Services Act 1980 and then on section 24 of the 1990 Act,which replaced section 28.  Furthermore, it does not appear from thematerial before the Court that these measures were motivated by anyconsiderations other than those mentioned in the relevantprovisions, namely the protection of the children's health.  Thereis no evidence for the contention that they were taken in order toprevent the reunion of Helena and Thomas with their parents.         Moreover, the measures had been upheld on appeals to, orbeen renewed by, the administrative courts, albeit in some instancessubject to certain time-limits (see paragraphs 14-17, 22-23 and25-27 above).  In this connection, it is to be recalled that it isprimarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, tointerpret and apply domestic law (see, inter alia, the Margareta andRoger Andersson v. Sweden judgment of 25 February 1992, Series Ano. 226-A, pp. 27-28, para. 82). 80.     Having regard to the foregoing, the Court, like theCommission and the Government,  considers that the prohibition onremoval and its maintenance in force were "in accordance with thelaw".                 (b) Restrictions on access 81.     On the other hand, according to an authoritativeinterpretation of Swedish law by the Supreme Administrative Court inthe present case, the imposition of restrictions on access while aprohibition on removal under the Social Services Act 1980 was inforce lacked any legal effect, as there was then no legal provisionon which such restrictions could be based (see paragraph 33 aboveand the above-mentioned Eriksson judgment, Series A no. 156, p. 25,para. 65).  This situation lasted from 23 June 1987 to 1 July 1990,when the 1990 Act entered into force.  During this period, theimpugned restrictions - as conceded by the Government - were not "inaccordance with the law" for the purposes of Article 8 (art. 8). 82.     There has accordingly been a violation of Article 8 (art. 8)of the Convention in so far as concerns the restrictions on accessbetween 23 June 1987 and 1 July 1990.         2. Legitimate aim 83.     According to the applicants, the aim of the contestedmeasures was to prevent their reunion with Helena and Thomas.Moreover, they claimed that they had not been allowed to meet themon their own because the social welfare authorities and the fosterparents had been afraid that the children might disclose informationabout unsatisfactory living conditions in the foster homes. 84.     However, as already stated above (see paragraph 79), thereis no evidence that the purpose of the prohibition on removal andits maintenance in force was to hinder reunion; the Court shares theview of the Commission and the Government that this measure wasaimed at protecting the children's "health" and "rights andfreedoms". 85.     The Court considers that on this occasion it should examinethe aims of all the restrictions on access, irrespective of theirperiods of application.  It does not find it established that any ofthem was aimed at preventing the family's reunion or the disclosureof information of the kind indicated by the applicants.  On thecontrary, it is convinced that they pursued the same legitimate aimsas the measures referred to in paragraph 84 above.         3. "Necessary in a democratic society" 86.     According to the applicants, the interferences were not"necessary in a democratic society".  The Government contested thisallegation but the Commission accepted it. 87.     In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction the Court mustdetermine whether the reasons given for the prohibition on removal,its maintenance in force until the transfer of custody and therestrictions on access which were in operation throughout thisperiod were "relevant and sufficient" in the light of the case as awhole (see the Olsson I judgment, p. 32, para. 68).  Thisdetermination must start with the Social Council's decision of23 June 1987 - immediately after the Supreme Administrative Court'sjudgment of 18 June 1987 terminating the public care - to prohibitremoval of Helena and Thomas from their respective foster homes.         That decision - which was unanimously upheld, at threelevels, by administrative courts which had the benefit of reportsfrom child psychiatrists and a psychologist as well as fromspecialised agencies was essentially based on the consideration thatseparating the children from their foster homes would, in thecircumstances obtaining at the time, involve a serious risk of harmto the children's physical and mental health (see paragraphs 12-17above).         The prohibition on removal order must be evaluated againstthe following background which appears from the file.         Helena and Thomas had been cared for in the foster homes fora long period that had begun at the end of 1980, in fact for most oftheir lives.  Their contacts with their natural parents had beenvery sparse indeed: they had not met their mother since 1984, theyhad since seen their father only once and there had been no othercontacts with their parents.  They had become strongly attached totheir respective foster families and environment, in which they haddeveloped in a positive and harmonious manner.  Both children hadexpressed a strong wish to remain in the foster homes, had shownanxiety about the possibility of being forced to return to theirnatural parents and had indicated that they would run away were theyto be so returned.  Helena was in an important phase of her personaldevelopment, which might be impaired if she were to be returnedagainst her own wishes.  Thomas had suffered from certain childhooddisturbances and was still psychologically very vulnerable as wellas emotionally dependent upon his foster parents.  Separating himfrom the latter was likely to cause him considerable andlong-lasting psychological harm.         Against this background the reasons for ordering theprohibition on removal were, in the Court's opinion, both relevantand sufficient. 88.     The prohibition on removal lasted until the transfer ofcustody, that is, for a total of three and a half years (June 1987 -January 1991).  The original order was upheld in three sets ofproceedings and was twice renewed, in 1989 by the Social Council andin 1990, under the 1990 Act, by the County Administrative Court.The applicants appealed each time, but these appeals wereunanimously dismissed (see paragraphs 14-17 and 21-27 above).         In all of these decisions the national courts found thatthere remained a serious risk that separating the children fromtheir foster homes would harm them; they pointed out in particularthat there had been insufficient preparatory contacts between themand the applicants.         Given that the factors indicated in paragraph 87 above didnot essentially change during the period under review, the Courtfinds that the reasons for the maintenance in force of theprohibition on removal were in any case "relevant".  Whether theywere also "sufficient" cannot be ascertained without inquiring why,despite the fact that as early as the first set of proceedingsrelating to the prohibition on removal the Swedish courts had timeand again stressed the crucial importance of adequate preparatorycontacts, these contacts remained insufficient during the wholeperiod.  It is in this context that the restrictions on access haveto be assessed. 89.     The restrictions on access which applied throughout thisperiod amounted to the following: while the applicants were free tovisit the children in their foster homes as often as they wished,meetings outside those homes would be organised or allowed onlyunder such conditions as would dispel the children's apprehensions.         These restrictions - which were supported by opinions of twopsychiatrists and a psychologist (see paragraphs 40, 43 and 49above) and, above all, were in accordance with the repeated wishesof the children - were based on reasons similar to those underlyingthe prohibition on removal.  The authorities took the view that notonly the children's interests but also their rights under Article 8(art. 8) of the Convention prevented the authorities from allowingrequests for access under conditions which were unacceptable to thechildren.         In view of the situation which obtained, the Court findsthat the restrictions on access were based on reasons which were"relevant" when it comes to ascertaining whether these restrictionswere "necessary in a democratic society".  It remains to be seenwhether they also were "sufficient": for this purpose they must beassessed in the context indicated at the end of paragraph 88 above. 90.     In doing so, the Court notes firstly that, both underSwedish law and under Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, thelifting of the care order implied that the children should, inprinciple, be reunited with their natural parents.  In cases likethe present, Article 8 (art. 8) includes a right for the naturalparents to have measures taken with a view to their being reunitedwith their children (see, as the most recent authority, the Rieme v.Sweden judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 226-B, p. 71,para. 69) and an obligation for the national authorities to takesuch measures.         However, neither the right of the parents nor itscounterpart, the obligation of the national authorities, isabsolute, since the reunion of natural parents with children whohave lived for some time in a foster family needs preparation.  Thenature and extent of such preparation may depend on thecircumstances of each case, but it always requires the active andunderstanding co-operation of all concerned.  Whilst nationalauthorities must do their utmost to bring about such co-operation,their possibilities of applying coercion in this respect are limitedsince the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of allconcerned must be taken into account, notably the children'sinterests and their rights under Article 8 (art. 8) of theConvention.  Where contacts with the natural parents would harmthose interests or interfere with those rights, it is for thenational authorities to strike a fair balance (see, mutatismutandis, the Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom judgment of21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, p. 18, para. 41).         In sum, what will be decisive is whether the nationalauthorities have made such efforts to arrange the necessarypreparations for reunion as can reasonably be demanded under thespecial circumstances of each case.         It is for the Court to review whether the nationalauthorities have fulfilled this obligation.  In doing so, it willleave room for a margin of appreciation, if only because it has tobase itself on the case-file, whereas the domestic authorities hadthe benefit of direct contact with all those concerned. 91.     In this connection the Court notes in the first place thatthe judgments rendered by the Swedish courts during the period underconsideration contain some passages which might be understood ascriticising the social welfare authorities for deficiencies in themaking of appropriate preparations for reunion, but equally asurging them not to let themselves be influenced by the antagonisticcourse taken by the applicants and their counsel.  However, thejudgments which were given afterwards, in the transfer of custodyproceedings, clearly take the view that the main responsibility forthe necessary preparations not having been made lay with theapplicants.         Indeed, the Swedish courts repeatedly stressed that in orderto arrange adequate preparatory contacts, good co-operation betweenthe social welfare authorities and the foster parents on the onehand and the applicants on the other hand was essential.Nevertheless, the applicants, although they knew that the accessrestrictions corresponded to the children's wishes, refused toaccept them.  They visited the children at the foster homes onlytwice (see paragraph 29 above) and also neglected other possibleforms of contact, such as contact by telephone.  Rather than followthe course of co-operation recommended by the courts, the applicantsinstead chose that of continuous hostility: again and again theydemanded access at their home without the foster parents' presence,which, as they were well aware, was unacceptable not only to thesocial welfare authorities but also to the children.  In addition,they responded to the failure to comply with their demands bylodging complaints with the police and numerous appeals (seeparagraphs 32-34, 46 and 50-52 above).         The social welfare authorities, for their part, tried topersuade the applicants to visit the children in their foster homes,offering to make the necessary arrangements and reimburse theirtravel costs and subsistence expenses.  Furthermore, they organiseda meeting in Gothenburg and, after consultation with two experts,drew up an access plan which cannot be said to have been undulyrestrictive and seems to have satisfied the exigencies of thesituation.  Although this plan was rejected by the applicants, thesocial welfare authorities tried, with partial success, to put itinto effect (see paragraphs 29 and 41 above).         In the light of the foregoing, the Court, having regard tothe margin of appreciation to be left to the national authorities,has come to the conclusion that it has not been established that thesocial welfare authorities failed to fulfil their obligation to takemeasures with a view to the applicants being reunited with Helenaand Thomas.         Accordingly, the maintenance in force of the prohibition onremoval and the restrictions on access were based on reasons thatwere not only "relevant" but also, in the circumstances,"sufficient" (see paragraph 88 above). 92.     The question whether the interferences with the applicants'right to respect for family life were "necessary" must therefore beanswered in the affirmative.  Consequently, their complaint underArticle 8 (art. 8) fails on this point. III.    ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 53 (art. 53) OF THE CONVENTION 93.     The applicants complained that, despite the Court's Olsson Ijudgment, the Swedish authorities had continued to prevent theirreunion with Helena and Thomas; the applicants had still not beenallowed to meet the children under circumstances which would haveenabled them to re-establish parent-child relationships.  In theirview, Sweden had continued to act in breach of Article 8 (art. 8)and had thereby failed to comply with its obligations underArticle 53 (art. 53) of the Convention, which reads as follows:         "The High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the        decision of the Court in any case to which they are        parties."         This allegation was disputed by the Government, whereas theCommission did not express an opinion on the matter.         By Resolution DH (88)18, adopted on 26 October 1988,concerning the execution of the Olsson I judgment, the Committee ofMinisters, "having satisfied itself that the Government of Swedenhas paid to the applicants the sums provided for in the judgment",declared that it had "exercised its functions under Article 54(art. 54) of the Convention". 94.     The Court further notes that the facts and circumstancesunderlying the applicants' complaint under Article 53 (art. 53)raised a new issue which was not determined by the Olsson I judgment(p. 29, para. 57) and are essentially the same as those which wereconsidered above under Article 8 (art. 8), in respect of which noviolation was found (see paragraphs 87-92 above).         In these circumstances, no separate issue arises underArticle 53 (art. 53). IV.     ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 1 (art. 6-1) OF THE        CONVENTION 95.     Mr and Mrs Olsson also complained of several violations ofArticle 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), which provides:         "In the determination of his civil rights and obligations        ... everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a        reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal ..."     A.  Judicial review of restrictions on access 96.     The Government, like the Commission, accepted theapplicants' contention that there had been a violation ofArticle 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) on the ground that it was not possiblefor them, until the entry into force of the 1990 Act on 1 July 1990,to have the restrictions on their access to Helena and Thomasreviewed by a court (see paragraphs 33, 34, 51, 62, 73 and 74above). 97.     For the reasons set out in the above-mentioned Erikssonjudgment (Series A no. 156, p. 29, paras. 80-81), the Court agrees.Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 6 para. 1(art. 6-1) on this point.     B.  Length of certain proceedings 98.     The applicants alleged that the duration of several of thedomestic proceedings in their case had, contrary to Article 6para. 1 (art. 6-1), exceeded a reasonable time.         The Government contested this allegation, which was rejectedby the Commission. 99.     The reasonableness of the length of proceedings is to beassessed in the light of the criteria laid down in the Court's case-law, in particular the complexity of the case, the conduct of theapplicant and that of the relevant authorities.  On the latterpoint, what is at stake for the applicant in the litigation has tobe taken into account in certain cases (see, for instance, the X v.France judgment of 31 March 1992, Series A no. 236, pp. 89-90,para. 32).         1.      The proceedings relating to one of the requests made                by the applicants for termination of the public care 100.    The applicants maintained that the examination of one oftheir requests for termination of the public care of Helena, Thomasand Stefan (see paragraph 10 above) had not been concluded within a"reasonable time". 101.    The Court considers - and this was not in dispute beforeit - that the starting-point for the relevant periods was16 August 1984, when the applicants submitted their request to theSocial Council. The periods in question ran until 16 February 1987,when the public care of Stefan was revoked by the AdministrativeCourt of Appeal, and 18 June 1987, when that of Helena and Thomaswas terminated by the Supreme Administrative Court, thus lastingapproximately two years and six months and two years and ten months,respectively. 102.    The proceedings concerning Stefan lasted approximatelythirteen months before the Social Council, four and a half monthsbefore the County Administrative Court and twelve months before theAdministrative Court of Appeal; those in respect of Helena andThomas took approximately two and a half months before the SocialCouncil, eleven months before the County Administrative Court,sixteen and a half months before the Administrative Court of Appealand four months before the Supreme Administrative Court.         The proceedings were of a complex nature, involvingdifficult assessments and requiring extensive investigations.Hearings were held before the County Administrative Court in thecase of Helena and Thomas and before the Administrative Court ofAppeal in the case of all three children. 103.    There are only two instances in which it is questionablewhether the competent authorities proceeded with proper diligence.         Firstly, it took the Social Council thirteen months todecide on the request concerning Stefan.  However, the Governmentexplained that this had been due to certain investigations deemed tobe necessary and the Court accepts this argument.         Secondly, the Administrative Court of Appeal had initiallyscheduled a hearing for 21 August 1986, but postponed it until4 February 1987.  Whilst indicating that they could not state withany certainty the reasons for this delay, the Government drewattention to the fact that, between 17 July and 20 November 1986,the case-file had not been with the Administrative Court of Appeal,but with the Supreme Administrative Court, which had had before itanother appeal by the applicants.  However, this does notsufficiently explain why the hearing was postponed for six months.In view of the nature of the interests at stake, it was of greatimportance, as the Commission also noted, that such matters be dealtwith swiftly.         Nevertheless, having regard to the complexity of the case,the delay was not so long as to warrant the conclusion that thetotal duration of the proceedings was excessive.         2.      The proceedings relating to the applicants' request                under Chapter 21 of the Parental Code 104.    Mr and Mrs Olsson further claimed that the proceedingsconcerning their request to have Helena and Thomas returned to them,in accordance with section 7 of Chapter 21 of the Parental Code (seeparagraph 18 above), had exceeded a reasonable time.         Both the Government and the Commission disagreed.         In their main submission the Government disputed theapplicability of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), on the ground thatthe proceedings in issue had been concerned only with theenforcement of existing rights and not with the determination of theexistence or the content of such rights.         The Court has come to a different conclusion.  There is nodoubt that the outcome of the proceedings in issue affected, in adecisive manner, the exercise by the applicants of an essentialaspect of their rights in respect of the custody of the children(see, amongst many authorities, the Skärby v. Sweden judgment of28 June 1990, Series A no. 180-B, p. 36, para. 27).  Theirapplication to the County Administrative Court for the transfer ofthe children thus gave rise to a "contestation" (dispute) over oneof their "civil rights" for the purposes of Article 6 para. 1(art. 6-1).  Consequently, this provision is applicable to theproceedings in question. 105.    As to whether the proceedings complied with the requirementof reasonable time, the Court observes that they lasted for a periodof thirteen and a half months and comprised three levels ofjurisdiction.  Like the Commission, it does not find this to beexcessive for the purposes of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).         3.      The proceedings relating to the second appointment                of a guardian ad litem 106.    The applicants further contended that the proceedingsconcerning the second appointment of a guardian ad litem (seeparagraph 20 above) had exceeded a "reasonable time".         These proceedings lasted a little more than a year andincluded three levels of jurisdiction.  The Court agrees with theCommission that they were concluded within a reasonable time.         4.      Conclusion 107.    There has accordingly been no breach of Article 6 para. 1(art. 6-1) on the three above-mentioned points. V.      MISCELLANEOUS ALLEGATIONS OF VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 6 PARA.1        AND 13 (art. 6-1, art. 13) 108.    Before the Commission the applicants submitted that, in thefirst set of proceedings challenging the prohibition on removal,there had been a breach of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), in that theSupreme Administrative Court had refused to hold a hearing (seeparagraph 17 above).  They also alleged that, contrary to thisprovision, they had not been able to challenge the District Court'sfirst appointment, on 17 July 1987, of a guardian ad litem forHelena and Thomas, since they had not been informed of this decision(see paragraph 19 above).  In addition, they complained that theydid not have an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13(art. 13) in respect of the restrictions on access and the decisionof 17 July 1987 to appoint a guardian ad litem.         These complaints, which in the Commission's opinion wereunfounded or did not need examination, were not mentioned by theapplicants before the Court, which does not consider it necessary toexamine them of its own motion. VI.     APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) 109.    Mr and Mrs Olsson sought just satisfaction under Article 50(art. 50), according to which:         "If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a        legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting        Party is completely or partially in conflict with the        obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the        internal law of the said Party allows only partial        reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision        or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary,        afford just satisfaction to the injured party."     A.  Damage 110.    Under this provision the applicants sought 5,000,000 Swedishkronor for damage.  In support of their claim they maintained, interalia, that, despite the Olsson I judgment, the Swedish authoritieshad continued to deal with them in the same way.  The compensationawarded by the Court in that judgment had had no impact; asignificantly higher sum was therefore called for in the presentcase.         The Government considered the claim to be "out ofproportion".  They submitted that, should the Court uphold theircontentions on the merits, only a symbolic amount should be granted. 111.    The present judgment has found only violations of Article 8(art. 8), on account of the restrictions on the applicants' accessto Helena and Thomas imposed, for a certain period, without a properbasis in Swedish law, and of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), owing tothe absence of a court remedy against the restrictions (seeparagraphs 81-82 and 97 above).  The Court considers that theapplicants must, as a result, have suffered some non-pecuniarydamage which has not been compensated solely by the findings ofviolation.  Deciding on an equitable basis, it awards 50,000 Swedishkronor to the applicants jointly under this head.     B.  Legal fees and expenses 112.    The applicants claimed reimbursement of fees and expenses,totalling 1,286,000 Swedish kronor, in respect of the followingitems: (a)     1,269,000 kronor for 625 hours' work by their lawyer in        respect of the domestic and the Strasbourg proceedings and        for 80 hours for the preparation of her oral pleadings and        her appearance before the Court as well as for her journey        to Strasbourg (in each case at 1,800 kronor per hour); (b)     expenses relating to journeys by the lawyer to meet a former        foster daughter of the Larsson family in Northern Sweden        (7,000 kronor) and to attend a court hearing in Gävle        (2,000 kronor); (c)     3,000 kronor in respect of a further journey to see the        applicants and an appearance before the District Court in        Alingsås as well as photocopying and telephone calls; (d)     5,000 kronor to cover work by a translator checking the        manuscript of the lawyer's oral pleadings before the Court.         With regard to item (a), the Government submitted that costsreferable to the domestic proceedings did not warrant compensationunder Article 50 (art. 50); such costs could have been paid underthe Swedish legal aid scheme had the applicants applied for legalaid. Furthermore, in their view, the way in which the lawyer for theapplicants conducted the proceedings before the Commission should betaken into consideration.  The Government questioned whether thetime which she claimed to have spent on the case was necessary andconsidered the hourly rate charged too high.         Items (b) and (c), the Government pointed out, seemed to berelated, at least partly, to the domestic proceedings.  They wereprepared to pay reasonable compensation for item (d). 113.    As regards item (a), the Court notes that the applicants'lawyer agreed to act on the basis that she would not ask for feesunder the Swedish legal aid scheme.  Her clients have thereforeincurred liability to pay fees to her.  Legal fees referable tosteps taken, in both the domestic and the Strasbourg proceedings,with a view to preventing or obtaining redress for the matters foundby the Court to constitute violations of Articles 6 para. 1 and 8(art. 6-1, art. 8) of the Convention, were necessarily incurred andshould be reimbursed in so far as they were reasonable (see, forinstance, the Olsson I judgment, Series A no. 130, p. 43,para. 104).         Bearing in mind that the applicants have succeeded only onthe points mentioned in paragraph 111 above and making an assessmenton an equitable basis, the Court considers that the applicantsshould be awarded under this head 50,000 kronor, from which must bededucted the 6,900 French francs already received from the Councilof Europe in respect of legal costs. 114.    Items (b) and (c) must be rejected as there is no evidencethat they were necessarily incurred.  On the other hand, the Courtis satisfied that item (d) - translation costs - was necessarilyincurred and was reasonable as to quantum. FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT 1.      Holds by six votes to three that there has been no violation        of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention in respect of the        prohibition on removal; 2.      Holds unanimously that there has been a violation of        Article 8 (art. 8) on account of the restrictions on access        imposed between 23 June 1987 and 1 July 1990; 3.      Holds by six votes to three that there has been no violation        of Article 8 (art. 8) on account of the restrictions on        access imposed after 1 July 1990; 4.      Holds unanimously that there has been a violation of        Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) in that no court remedy was        available to challenge the restrictions on access imposed        between 23 June 1987 and 1 July 1990; 5.      Holds unanimously that there has been no violation of        Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) as regards any of the other        points raised by the applicants before the Commission and        the Court; 6.      Holds by seven votes to two that no separate issue arises        under Article 53 (art. 53); 7.      Holds unanimously that it is not necessary to examine the        other complaints, under Articles 6 para. 1 and 13 (art. 6-1,        art. 13), which the applicants made before the Commission        but did not reiterate before the Court; 8.      Holds unanimously that Sweden is to pay to the applicants        jointly, within three months, 50,000 (fifty thousand)        Swedish kronor for non-pecuniary damage, and, for legal fees        and expenses, 55,000 (fifty-five thousand) Swedish kronor        less 6,900 (six thousand nine hundred) French francs to be        converted into Swedish kronor at the rate applicable on the        date of delivery of the present judgment; 9.      Dismisses unanimously the remainder of the claim for just        satisfaction.         Done in English and in French and delivered at a publichearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on27 November 1992. Signed: Rolv RYSSDAL        President Signed: Marc-André EISSEN        Registrar         In accordance with Article 51 para. 2 (art. 51-2) of theConvention and Rule 53 para. 2 of the Rules of Court, the partlydissenting opinion of Mr Pettiti, joined by Mr Matscher andMr Russo, is annexed to this judgment. Initialled: R.R. Initialled: M.-A.E          PARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE PETTITI, JOINED BY                      JUDGES MATSCHER* AND RUSSO _______________* Except as regards the penultimate paragraph on page 46._______________                              (Translation)         I did not vote with the majority of the Chamber for the non-violation of Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on HumanRights as regards the prohibition on removal and restrictions onaccess (points 1 and 3 of the operative provisions).  I consider, onthe contrary, that there has been a serious violation of thatArticle (art. 8) in respect both of the prohibition on removal andof the restrictions on access after 1 July 1990, on the same linesas the findings in the Olsson I judgment (see particularlyparagraph 81 which set out the reasons for concluding that Swedenhad failed to comply with Article 8 in that case) (art. 8).         It appears clear that the social welfare officials did nottake all the steps that they should have done in the light of thatjudgment with a view to promoting the exercise of the right ofaccess and the right to have the children to stay which would haveprepared the way for returning custody of the children to theirparents.         Where the child has been separated from his parents over along period (as was the case here and this was a situation for whichthe social welfare authorities bore some responsibility in respectof the period covered by the Olsson I judgment), flexible andsensitive measures must be taken.         In order to put reflection on the Olsson II judgment moreclearly in context, it is helpful to recall the principal reasoningof the Olsson I judgment (in which a violation was found by twelvevotes to three):         "82.    There is nothing to suggest that the Swedish        authorities did not act in good faith in implementing the        care decision.  However, this does not suffice to render a        measure 'necessary' in Convention terms ...: an objective        standard has to be applied in this connection.  Examination        of the Government's arguments suggests that it was partly        administrative difficulties that prompted the authorities'        decisions; yet, in so fundamental an area as respect for        family life, such considerations cannot be allowed to play        more than a secondary role.         83.     In conclusion, in the respects indicated above and        despite the applicants' unco-operative attitude ..., the        measures taken in implementation of the care decision were        not supported by 'sufficient' reasons justifying them as        proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.  They were        therefore, notwithstanding the domestic authorities' margin        of appreciation, not 'necessary in a domestic society'."         The Committee of Ministers confined itself to declaring thatthe pecuniary awards made under Article 50 (art. 50) of theConvention had been duly paid by the Government.         For all the periods considered, the authorities should havetaken steps to ensure: the psychological preparation of the childrenand the progressive organisation repeated at least each month ofmeetings, at first short ones, if necessary even in the presence ofa psychologist; these meetings could subsequently have been extendedto a day, a weekend, a part of the holidays, under differentconditions to those obtaining for the five series of meetingsreferred to in the judgment.  The aim would be to avoid a situationin which the child, being conditioned by the foster family, adopteda deliberately obstructive attitude to these visits, which evidentlyposed a problem.  It would also have been helpful to make a greatereffort to prepare the parents for the progressive stages, makingallowance for their frustration, for a degree of maladroitresistance on their part as well as for the difficulties arisingfrom the need to travel because of the unfortunate choice of thefoster families in terms of the geographical location of their home.The most important thing was to take account of the parents'persistent efforts to secure the return of their children, despiteall the obstacles, which confirmed their parental attachment andtheir legitimate and consistent claim.  In my view, neither thesocial welfare authorities nor the majority of the European Courtsitting as a Chamber gave sufficient weight to the strength andextent of this attachment.  From 23 June 1987 to 16 June 1989, therewere only five actual meetings (see paragraph 29 of the judgment),and then no more during the relevant period.         It is true that since the Olsson I judgment these fiveattempts at meetings have taken place; the results wereunsatisfactory but that could have been a temporary situation.         However, in view of the large number of misunderstandingswhich had built up over the years, these attempts had no chance ofsucceeding without an adequate psychological preparation of theparties concerned.  It is the duty of the social welfareauthorities, and this is one of the most elementary principles ofthe methods of educative assistance practised in Europe, where thistype of conflict is frequent, to make specific arrangements.         It is impossible to overcome in a matter of a few hoursyears of mutual incomprehension.  Thousands of learned works byjudges, lawyers, doctors, psychiatrists or psychologists, have beenwritten on this subject.  The technique of using neutral ground formeetings and progressive contacts is common, under judicialsupervision.  In any event it is always counterproductive for theparents to have to meet their children on the home ground of thefoster family or in the latter's presence, because that often leadsto the failure of the attempt.         The social welfare authorities displayed what was almostcontempt both for the national courts and the European Court.  It issomewhat surprising that neither the courts nor the governmentalauthorities managed to force the "imperialism" of the socialservices to give ground.         At no time did the social welfare authorities take the leastaccount of the love for their children that the parents sought toexpress, a love that was demonstrated by the years of struggle inproceedings to seek to obtain the return of the children and therespect of their most sacred rights.         Clearly, the Olsson parents' attitude was not alwayshelpful, particularly after 1989, and they must therefore bear apart of the responsibility.  Yet one must not forget their despairafter the repeated failures with which they met even after thefavourable decisions of the European Court and the national courts(see paragraph 53 et seq. of the present judgment).         Adopting the tactics employed by their lawyers, which wereperhaps too extreme, they hardened their position, but legally theyhad a number of valid reasons for doing so.  In any case, theauthorities were under a duty to exert a positive influence, byshowing understanding and making repeated interventions, instead ofreinforcing the differences.         In this type of situation it is necessary to seek toorganise more and more meetings, to educate the children and theparents, to defuse conflicts. It is unfair to give priority to theobstinacy of the children and the foster families.         In the same connection, the long delays between eachproceedings or intervention made the situation worse, whereas inother States and in other jurisdictions, hearings would have beenheld at shorter intervals by means of an urgent procedure before achildren's judge.  One is left with the impression that theauthorities were content to allow the intransigence of the parentsto strengthen the position of the social welfare authorities,despite the fact that the latter had never disguised theirpreference for the foster families, as if they sought to accordgreater weight to material comfort than to paternal and maternalties.         Viewed from the outside this attitude towards the parentsmay seem somewhat "inhuman".         It is to be regretted that reference was not made to theUnited Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child so as to permitthe intervention of the children assisted by their lawyers, whocould have played a useful role as mediators.         Whatever the case may be, the general and overall conduct ofthe authorities was such that the parents are permanently separatedfrom their children, and this situation is now irreparable as aresult of the refusal to allow access, a right which is not evenrefused to criminal parents in other countries.  The Olsson parentshave been definitively cut off from any family relationship.  It isdifficult to think of a more serious case of a violation of thefundamental rights protected by Article 8 (art. 8).         As I voted for the violation of the prohibition on removaland the restriction on access before and after 1990, I also considerthat the Court should have examined the case under Article 53(art. 53) and analysed the decision of the Committee of Ministers inthe light of the European Court's judgment in the first Olsson case.         It is paradoxical that in the year of the implementation ofthe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, whichstresses the importance of parent-child relations, there should havebeen such a failure in the application of Article 8 (art. 8) of theEuropean Convention.
