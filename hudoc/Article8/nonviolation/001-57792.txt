The last two numbers indicate thecase's position on the list of cases referred to the Court sinceits creation and on the list of the corresponding originatingapplications to the Commission. ** As amended by Article 11 of Protocol No. 8 (P8-11), which cameinto force on 1 January 1990._______________ PROCEDURE 1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commissionof Human Rights ("the Commission") and by the Government of theKingdom of Sweden ("the Government") on 14 and 17 December 1990respectively, within the three-month period laid down byArticle 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of theConvention.  It originated in an application (no. 12366/86) againstSweden lodged with the Commission under Article 25(art. 25) by Mr Antero Rieme, a Finnish citizen, on 28 July 1986.      The Commission's request referred to Articles 44 and 48(art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognisedthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46).The object of the Government's application and of the request wasto obtain a decision as to whether or not the facts of the casedisclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations underArticle 8 (art. 8). 2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance withRule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant statedthat he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated thelawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).  The Finnish Government,having been informed by the Registrar of its right to intervene inthe proceedings (Article 48, sub-paragraph (b) of the Conventionand Rule 33 para. 3(b)) (art. 48-b), did not indicate any intentionof so doing. 3.   The Chamber to be constituted included ex officioMrs E. Palm, the elected judge of Swedish nationality(Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, thePresident of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)).

Valticos,Mr I. Foighel and Mr A.N. Loizou (Article 43 in fine of theConvention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). 4.   Mr Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber(Rule 21 para. 5) and, through the Registrar, consulted the Agentof the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyerfor the applicant on the organisation of the procedure (Rules 37para. 1 and 38).  Thereafter, in accordance with the orders made inconsequence, the Registrar received the applicant's memorial on 24April and the Government's memorial on 13 June 1991.      In a letter of 9 July the Secretary to the Commission informedthe Registrar that the Delegate would submit her observations atthe hearing. 5.   On 15 November 1991 the Commission filed a number of documentswhich the Registrar had sought from it on the President'sinstructions.      On 25 September and 22 November 1991 the registry received,from the applicant, further details on his Article 50 (art. 50)claim, which the Court accepted (Rule 50), and documents from boththe applicant and the Government, as requested by the President. 6.   As further directed by the President, the hearing took placein public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on25 November 1991.  The Court had held a preparatory meetingbeforehand.      There appeared before the Court: (a)  for the Government      Mr H. Corell,        Ambassador, Under-Secretary for        Legal and Consular Affairs,        Ministry for Foreign Affairs,             Agent,      Ms I. Stenkula, Legal Adviser,        Ministry of Health and Social Affairs,      Ms E. Jagander, Legal Adviser,        Ministry for Foreign Affairs,             Advisers;  (b)  for the Commission      Mrs G.H. Thune,                              Delegate; (c)  for the applicant      Mr L. Hane, advokat,                         Counsel.      The Court heard addresses by Mr Corell for the Government, byMrs Thune for the Commission and by Mr Hane for the applicant, aswell as their replies to its questions. AS TO THE FACTS I.   Particular circumstances of the case      A. Background 7.   Mr Antero Rieme, a Finnish citizen born in 1940, resides atTumba, Sweden, and is a metal worker by profession.  He has adaughter, Susanne, together with Mrs J., with whom he cohabitedfrom January 1976 until March 1977.  The latter had legal custodyof Susanne from the time of her birth on 28 October 1976.  In 1980the applicant met Mrs Anita Mäkinen.  They have been livingtogether since that year and have been married since early 1983;she has taken the name of Anita Rieme. 8.   On 26 September 1977, when Susanne was eleven months old, theSouthern Social District Council (södra sociala distriktsnämnden)of Södertälje ("the Social Council") decided that she should betaken into public care pursuant to sections 25(a) and 29 of theChild Welfare Act 1960 (barnavårdslagen 1960:97 - "the 1960 Act"),because of her mother's alcohol problems.  Shortly afterwards, shewas placed in a foster home - with the Forsberg family - where shestayed until she moved to her father's home in August 1989 (seeparagraphs 23-24 below).  She returned to the foster home aroundChristmas 1989 (see paragraph 25 below). 9.   In January 1978 the applicant applied to the District Court(tingsrätten) of Södertälje for legal custody of Susanne.  In acustody report to the court, dated 21 September 1978, the socialwelfare authorities opposed his request, recommending instead thata special legal guardian be appointed.  The report observed, interalia, that the applicant had been reported several times foroffences of drunkenness.  It also noted that Susanne had becomecompletely integrated into the foster family and that the Forsbergchildren had accepted her as their own sister.  Mr and Mrs Forsberghad taken on their role as foster parents fully conscious of therealities of the situation.  They were prepared to take care ofSusanne for as long as necessary, on the understanding that thismight be until adulthood.  Mr Rieme withdrew his request, allegedlybecause the social welfare authorities had "threatened" to revokehis right of access to Susanne. 10.  On 30 November 1981 the applicant again asked the DistrictCourt to grant him legal custody.      As appears from the minutes of the court's hearing on 17 March1982, the court dismissed Mr Rieme's request for a provisionaltransfer of custody, so that the social welfare authorities couldcarry out a speedy examination of the question of custody.  Therelevant report was completed on 27 June 1983.  It noted, interalia, that according to a statement by the foster parents to thesocial welfare authorities, Susanne was not looked upon as a"foster child" - the expression was not even used in the fosterhome.  Moreover, they had stated that they did not know at theoutset how long Susanne's placement with them would last but thatit had become permanent.  The report concluded that it was not inSusanne's best interests to transfer the custody to the applicant.Instead, custody should be given to a third person. 11.  Nevertheless, by judgment of 28 September 1983, the courtordered that the custody of Susanne be transferred to Mr Rieme,having regard to, inter alia, the following considerations.  WhilstSusanne's placement in the foster home seemed consistent with herbest interests, the applicant had shown active concern for her andhad endeavoured to maintain contact.  To an outsider, hisendeavours could appear to have been unwise and might notcorrespond to a modern view of children's needs.  However, oneshould not attach undue importance to the applicant's lack ofinsight in this matter.  His wish to take care of Susanne was notunusual and seemed natural.  Furthermore, a transfer of custodywould not lead to termination of Susanne's placement in the fosterhome but would, on the other hand, enable the applicant to have theissue legally determined in the light of any changes which mightoccur in their situation.  Moreover, a transfer could stimulatefurther contacts and would be valuable to Susanne in the long run.The Social Council should see to it that such contacts did notconflict with her best interests. 12.  Susanne's mother, Mrs J., appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal(Svea hovrätt) which, however, confirmed the transfer of custody ina judgment of 21 June 1984.      B. Termination of public care and prohibition on removal 13.  In the meantime, on 11 October 1983, the applicant had askedthe Social Council, firstly, to terminate the public care ofSusanne and, secondly, to grant him access to her at regularintervals.  The social welfare officers responsible for the casecarried out a review of the question of removing Susanne from thefoster home and, on 16 October 1984, following a hearing at whichthe applicant, his lawyer and his wife - Mrs Anita Rieme - werepresent, the Social Council granted the care claim but did notdetermine the access claim.  At the same time, it decided, pursuantto section 28 of the Social Services Act 1980(socialtjänstlagen 1980:620), to prohibit the applicant fromremoving Susanne from the foster home, on the ground that there was"a risk, which was not of a minor nature", that her mental healthcould thereby be harmed.  This decision was based on the socialwelfare officers' report and recommendation to the Social Council,dated 28 September 1984. 14.  The report, which was attached to the recommendation, set outthe background of the case and analysed the relationships betweenfather and daughter, as well as interviews which the social workershad carried out with the Rieme and Forsberg spouses.  It alsoreviewed Susanne's health and development and her need to remainwith the Forsberg family.  The report relied on a psychiatricopinion, appended thereto, from the Institution for Child and YouthPsychiatry ("PBU") in Stockholm which was dated 7 June 1984 andsigned by Mr Jarkko Rantanen, psychologist, and Dr Sari Granström,chief physician.  The opinion observed, inter alia, the following:      Susanne had been living in the foster home since she waseleven months old.  Her contacts with the biological mother hadbeen interrupted whereas those with the applicant had continued ona regular basis.  However, in her eyes, the foster parents assumedthe role of her parents; she had not developed equally strongemotional ties with the applicant and his wife.  Similarly, sheconsidered the other children (three natural daughters and onefoster son) in the Forsberg home as her own brother and sisters.Removing Susanne from this home would involve too many changes forher: she would not only lose her much needed feeling of securityand psychological support derived from the Forsberg home, herfriends, her school and daily routines but she would also be facedwith unreasonably difficult problems of adaptation in a newenvironment.  Susanne had shown a tendency to react physically tosignificant changes.  She suffered from various psychosomaticdisorders - including enuresis and recurring stomach pains whichwere likely to get worse in the event of a removal.  This wouldalso entail a risk of her becoming increasingly depressed anddistant.  Before removal could take place, Susanne's relationshipwith the applicant and his wife needed to evolve further.  Thequestion of removal should not be discussed with her until she hadbecome sufficiently mature and she should not be subjected tofurther examinations related to this issue within the next fewyears.      Further contacts between the applicant and Susanne shoulddevelop in collaboration with the foster parents.  If those ties,which had already been established through regular meetings, wereto be able to continue, the applicant would need a great deal ofsupport in order to be capable of maintaining and furthering theirrelationship, with due regard to the needs of his daughter.      C. First set of proceedings challenging the prohibitionon removal 15.  The applicant lodged an appeal with the County AdministrativeCourt (länsrätten) in Stockholm against the prohibition on removal.The court held a hearing in camera on 22 January 1985 at which theapplicant and his wife were present and represented by counsel.  Aswitnesses, it heard the foster parents, at the applicant's request,and Dr Granström and Mr Rantanen, at the request of the SocialCouncil.      In its judgment of 25 January 1985, the court recalled thatthe Social Council's decision to terminate the public care ofSusanne implied that the applicant's personal circumstances did notas such constitute an obstacle to reuniting them.  On the otherhand, the court had regard to the Social Council's assessment,based on the above-mentioned psychiatric opinion (see paragraph 14above), that remaining in the foster home was in Susanne's bestinterests.  She was a sensitive, fragile and vulnerable girl whowould lose her feeling of security and show certain psychosomaticsymptoms if she were to be immediately removed from the fosterhome.  Against this background, the court considered that removalwould involve a risk, which was not of a minor nature, of harmingher mental health.  On balancing Susanne's interests against thoseof the applicant, for which the court expressed great sympathy, itfound that there were preponderant reasons in favour of allowingSusanne to remain in the foster home until further notice.Consequently, the appeal was dismissed. 16.  Mr Rieme appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal(kammarrätten) in Stockholm, requesting that the prohibition onremoval be lifted and, in the alternative, that the duration of theprohibition be limited.  The court dismissed the appeal by judgmentof 2 August 1985, which contained the following reasons:      "The aim of the provisions of section 28 of the Social     Services Act is to safeguard the best interests of the child.     Among the circumstances which must be considered in that     context are the age of the child and his or her abilities and     emotional ties.  Furthermore, regard must be had, inter alia,     to the child's own wishes and to how long the child has been     cared for in the [foster] home.      Susanne ... has been cared for in the foster home since     October 1977 and thus for the major part of her life.  She is     considered to be a sensitive child and has had certain     psychosomatic symptoms.  After the County Administrative     Court's examination of the question of the removal of Susanne,     it appears that the relationship between Susanne and [the     applicant] has developed in a favourable manner.  The     Administrative Court of Appeal finds, however, that an     enforced removal still involves a risk of harming Susanne's     mental health, a risk which is not of a minor nature.  The     request to lift the prohibition from taking Susanne away from     the foster home cannot therefore be granted.  The question of     when the prohibition can be lifted depends on how the contacts     between [the applicant] and Susanne develop in the future.     The Administrative Court of Appeal finds that the prohibition     cannot at present be limited in time." 17.  On 23 September 1985 the applicant applied for leave to appealto the Supreme Administrative Court (regeringsrätten).  Leave wasrefused on 26 March 1986.      D.   Particulars concerning the applicant's contacts with his daughter 18.  The social welfare officers' above-mentioned report (seeparagraphs 13-14 above) provided the following information on theapplicant's contacts with Susanne:      "When Susanne was taken into public care and placed in a     foster home in 1977, Antero Rieme maintained quite regular     contacts with her.  Until early February 1978 he visited her     about once a week.  Subsequently, the frequency of visits     decreased and, for a period, he did not visit Susanne at all.     During this period [he] kept himself informed about [her]     well-being through Esko Forsberg, who was a colleague at that     time.  The following year the visits became more regular     [although] with varying frequency.  Susanne recognised [her     father] and called him 'my second daddy'.  [He] showed     interest in [her].  In August 1981 [he] expressed the wish     that [she] come to his and Anita's ... home for some weekends.     He planned to apply for the custody of the child and wanted     [the care] to be gradually transferred to him.  The social     welfare officer then responsible for the case would not assist     in arranging for Susanne's transfer until the question of     custody had been determined, but approved of [her] visiting     the applicant occasionally at weekends, when one of the     Forsberg spouses was to accompany her.  It was also decided     that [the applicant] should visit Susanne in the foster home     once a month.      In connection with her review of the question of custody,     dated [27 June 1983], Yvonne Zäll, Head of Section, considered     also the issue of a right of access.  It was agreed that the     entire Forsberg family should visit the Rieme couple and,     moreover, that Susanne should visit them, accompanied by Minna     Forsberg.  In the beginning, Susanne would not go alone -     without Riita and Minna Forsberg - but after a while it became     easier for her to be on her own with the Rieme spouses.  She     has only been there at daytime, as she did not want to stay     overnight.  It follows from the review of the question of     custody that Susanne was happy about the father's visits to     the [foster] family and that the foster parents' attitude to     them was positive.      Since the District Court decided that the custody of Susanne     should be vested in Antero Rieme, the Social Council ...     reviewed the question of removal.  An agreement was reached     with Antero Rieme that access, pending the review, should take     place as follows:  Susanne, Antero and Anita Rieme should meet     two Saturdays a month, one Saturday ... [at Forsbergs' home]     and one Saturday ... [at] the Riemes'.      Access should take place on condition that Susanne was     positive about [it].  The father wished to have the access     extended so as to receive Susanne for visits at his home every     other weekend from Friday night to Sunday night and for a week     in connection with the weekend of New Year's Eve.  Since it     was of importance not to disturb or confuse Susanne, the     social welfare authorities and [the applicant] reached a     written agreement that no changes should be made concerning     access pending the examination [of the question of removal].     Nevertheless, in practice the access arrangements were changed     since the social workers agreed with Antero Rieme and the     Forsberg family that Susanne could spend the night at the     Riemes' ... home, should she so wish.  So far she has not.     She has clearly stated that she does not wish to stay     overnight at [their] home.  She has not been able to provide     any reasons for this.  It has also happened that the Rieme     spouses came to the foster home merely to collect her [,     without actually visiting her in her home environment]." 19.  According to the applicant, the social welfare authorities hadaccepted, subject to further arrangements, that the child couldstay overnight at his home in the month of May 1984.  However, hestated that this did not materialise, apparently because they hadtold the foster parents not to mention anything to Susanne aboutit. 20.  In a memorandum of 14 June 1985 addressed to theAdministrative Court of Appeal (in the proceedings concerningprohibition on removal) the social welfare officer responsible forthe case stressed that contacts between Susanne and the applicantshould evolve slowly and gradually.  Her own wishes in this respectwere of particular importance.  At her own request, she had stayedovernight three times at her father's home during the last coupleof months.  She had clearly indicated that, for the time being, sheonly wished to spend one night at a time there and that she did notwish to join her father and his wife for a fortnight's holiday inFinland in the summer of 1985.      However, according to the applicant, Susanne had expressed adesire to go with them on holiday to Finland.  When he contactedthe social welfare officer on the issue, the latter maintained, inher letter dated 24 June 1985, that Susanne had stated the contraryto her and that one should respect Susanne's choice.  Meanwhile,she hoped that the applicant and Susanne would get to know eachother better by the time of the next school vacation or anotherholiday.  In addition, under section 28 of the Social Services Act,the Social Council had power to decide where Susanne was to stay.Consequently, the applicant was not in a position to decide thematter. 21.  As from May 1986 Susanne stayed overnight every second week-end with the applicant and his wife.  She spent parts of her summerholidays with them in 1986 and 1987 in Finland and about one weekat Christmas 1987, as well as Easter 1988 and New Year 1988-89. 22.  In a memorandum of 15 December 1987 to the Ministry forForeign Affairs, apparently prepared in connection with theproceedings before the Commission, the Social Council noted thatthe measures taken by the social welfare authorities to bring aboutcloser contact between the applicant and his daughter, possiblyleading to her removal from the foster home, had essentiallyconsisted of providing support to Susanne and the foster home in amanner aimed at making her meetings and holidays with the applicantas natural as possible.  Furthermore, the social welfareauthorities had supported initiatives taken by the foster parentsto improve their contacts with the applicant.      However, according to the memorandum, the applicant haddeclined contact with the social welfare authorities since theautumn of 1985, making it more difficult for them to work for abetter relationship between him and the foster parents.      Furthermore, Susanne was mature for her age and had becomeincreasingly able to express her own views.  The social welfareauthorities had considered as decisive her wishes as to how thecontacts with the applicant were to be arranged.  She had stayed inthe foster home since the age of one and had strong emotional tieswith the foster parents.  The continued development of the contactsbetween the applicant and Susanne should therefore take place ather own pace and removal should only occur when she desired it.      E.   Second set of proceedings challenging the prohibition on          removal 23.  On 1 September 1989 the applicant again asked the SocialCouncil to lift the prohibition on removal.  At that time, Susannehad been staying with him since school started in August.  Afterreviewing the matter, the social welfare officers submitted areport to the Social Council, noting that Susanne's psychosomaticsymptoms had disappeared a few years earlier and that her contactswith the applicant and his wife had been close and had increasedsteadily at her own pace.  The relationship between the applicantand the foster parents had been very tense over the years and forlong periods they had not had any contact at all.  Susanne hadfound herself in the difficult position of having to move backwardsand forwards between the families.  However, she seemed to havecoped with the situation and had showed attachment to both sets ofparents who were now co-operating in her best interests.  Since theend of August 1989 she had been staying with the Riemes, with herown and the foster parents' agreement, and was seeing the fosterparents whenever she wished.  In view of this, the social welfareofficers recommended that the prohibition on removal be lifted. 24.  On 20 November 1989 the Social Council terminated theprohibition on removal.      F. Recent developments 25.  Around Christmas 1989 Susanne returned to the Forsbergs' home,where at her own wish she has been living ever since.  In January1990 the Forsbergs and the Riemes and Susanne met with the socialwelfare authorities in Södertälje.  On this occasion, the applicantdid not seem prepared to accept her staying with the Forsbergfamily, whereas the latter stated that they wished her to do so andwould not force her to leave.  The social welfare authorities haveas yet not taken any formal decision on the matter.      The applicant and his daughter have been in contact since herreturn to the Forsberg family; for instance, she visited him atEaster 1991. II.  Relevant domestic law 26.  Decisions concerning the applicant's child were based on theChild Welfare Act 1960 (barnavårdslagen 1960:97 - "the 1960 Act"),the Social Services Act 1980 (socialtjänstlagen 1980:620) and the1980 Act containing Special Provisions on the Care of Young Persons(lagen 1980:621 med särskilda bestämmelser om vård av unga - "the1980 Act").      The Social Services Act 1980 contains provisions regardingsupportive and preventive measures effected with the approval ofthe individuals concerned.  The 1980 Act (1980:621), which providedfor compulsory care measures, complemented the Social Services Act1980; when they entered into force on 1 January 1982, they replacedthe 1960 Act.  In general, decisions taken under the 1960 Act,which were still in force on 31 December 1981, were considered tohave been taken under the 1980 Act.  As from 1 July 1990 therelevant legislation has been amended (see paragraphs 40-43 below).      A. Compulsory care 27.  Under section 25(a) of the 1960 Act, the competent localauthority in child-care matters - the Child Welfare Board(barnavårdsnämnden) or, in Stockholm and Gothenburg, the SocialDistrict Council - was obliged to intervene:      "[if] a person, not yet eighteen years of age, is maltreated     in his home or otherwise treated there in a manner endangering     his bodily or mental health, or if his development is     jeopardised by the unfitness of his parent or other guardians     responsible for his upbringing or by their inability to raise     the child." 28.  If the Board found that the child's situation corresponded tothat described in section 25 of the 1960 Act, it had, beforeresorting to care, to endeavour to remedy the matter by preventivemeasures (förebyggande åtgärder).  These could consist of one ormore of the following steps: advice, material support, admonitionor warning, orders pertaining to the child's living conditions, orsupervision (section 26).  If such measures proved insufficient orwere considered pointless, the Board had to place the child in care(section 29). 29.  The conditions for compulsory care under the 1980 Act were setout in section 1, which read:      "Care is to be provided pursuant to this Act for persons under     eighteen years of age if it may be presumed that the necessary     care cannot be given to the young person with the consent of     the person or persons having custody of him and, in the case     of a young person aged fifteen or more, with the consent of     the young person.      Care is to be provided for a young person if      1. lack of care for him or any other condition in the home     entails a danger to his health or development, or      2. the young person is seriously endangering his health or     development by abuse of addictive substances, criminal     activity or any other comparable behaviour.      ... " 30.  It is primarily the responsibility of the municipalities topromote a positive development for the young.  For this purposeeach municipality has a Social District Council, composed of laymembers assisted by a staff of professional social workers. 31.  The Child Welfare Board - or, in Stockholm and Gothenburg, theSocial District Council - had power to take decisions on publiccare pursuant to the 1960 Act.  Under the 1980 Act, such decisionswere taken by the County Administrative Court, on application bythe Social Council.      When a decision on public care had been taken, the SocialCouncil (formerly the Child Welfare Board under the 1960 Act) wasto implement it, by attending to the practical details of suchmatters as placement, education and other treatment of the child(sections 35-36 and 38-41 of the 1960 Act and sections 11-16 of the1980 Act).      The 1980 Act required the care of the child to be carried outin such a way as to enable him to have close contacts with hisrelatives and to visit his home.  This requirement could mean thatthe child returns to his home, after a period, to live there,although he is still formally under public care (section 11 of the1980 Act). 32.  Under section 42(1) of the 1960 Act, compulsory care had to bediscontinued as soon as the aims of the care measures were deemedto have been achieved.      The corresponding rule in the 1980 Act provided that theSocial Council was obliged to monitor carefully the care and toterminate it when it was no longer necessary (section 5). 33.  At the relevant time, section 41 of the Social ServicesOrdinance 1981 (socialtjänstförordningen 1981:750) laid down thata care decision based on unsatisfactory conditions in the child'shome must be reconsidered by the Social Council regularly and atleast once a year.      Both before and after the entry into force of the 1980 Act, aparent who has custody of the child could, under the generalprinciples of Swedish administrative law, at any time request thatthe decision on public care be terminated. 34.  According to a report by a special committee on social affairs(Betänkande av Socialberedningen - SOU 1986:20), the social welfareauthorities in a number of municipalities have been operating adistinction between support placement (stödplacering) andsubstitute placement (ersättningsplacering), the latter designatinga more permanent form of placement.      B.   Prohibition on removal 35.  The Social Council could issue a prohibition on removal undersection 28 of the Social Services Act, which read as follows:      "The Social Council may for a certain period of time or until     further notice prohibit the guardian of a minor from taking     the minor from a home referred to in section 25 [i.e. a foster     home], if there is a risk, which is not of a minor nature, of     harming the child's physical or mental health if separated     from that home.      If there are reasonable grounds to assume that there is such     a risk, although the necessary investigations have not been     completed, a temporary prohibition may be issued for a maximum     period of four weeks, pending the final decision in the     matter.      A prohibition issued under this section does not prevent a     removal of the child from the home on the basis of a decision     under Chapter 21 of the Parental Code."      The preparatory work (Prop. 1979/80:1, p. 541) relevant tothis provision mentioned that a purely passing disturbance or otheroccasional disadvantage to the child was not sufficient ground forissuing a prohibition on removal.  It stated that the factors to beconsidered when deciding whether or not to issue such a prohibitionincluded the child's age, degree of development, character,emotional ties and present and prospective living conditions, aswell as the time he had been cared for away from the parents andhis contacts with them while separated.  If the child had reachedthe age of 15, his own preference should not be opposed withoutgood reasons; if he was younger, it was still an important factorto be taken into account.      The Standing Social Committee of the Parliament stated in itsreport (SOU 1979/80:44, p. 78), inter alia, that a prohibitionmight be issued if removal could involve a risk of harm to thechild's physical or mental health, thus even where no seriousobjections existed in regard to the guardian.  The Committee alsostressed that the provision was aimed at safeguarding the bestinterests of the child and that those interests must prevailwhenever they conflicted with the guardian's interest in decidingthe domicile of the child.  It also took as its point of departurethe assumption that a separation generally involved a risk of harmto the child.  Repeated transfers and transfers which took placeafter a long time, when the child had developed strong links withthe foster home, should thus not be accepted without good reasons:the child's need for secure relations and living conditions shouldbe decisive. 36.  Section 28 of the Social Services Act did not apply tochildren who were being cared for in foster homes under section 1of the 1980 Act.  As long as such care continued, the right of theguardian to determine the domicile of the child was suspended.Whilst that right in principle revived on the termination of suchcare, it could be further suspended by an application of section 28by the social welfare authorities. 37.  Under section 73 of the Social Services Act, a decision takenunder section 28 could be appealed to the administrative courts.In practice, besides the natural parents both the child concernedand the foster parents have been allowed to lodge such appeals.  Inthe proceedings before the administrative courts, a specialguardian may be appointed to protect the interests of the child,should these come into conflict with those of the child's legalguardian.      C. Regulation of access      1. During compulsory care 38.  The 1960 Act provided that the Child Welfare Board couldregulate a parent's right of access to his child in care to theextent that it found this reasonable in the light of the aims ofthe care decision, the upbringing of the child or othercircumstances (section 41).      Under the 1980 Act, restrictions on access could be imposed bythe Social Council, in so far as this was necessary for thepurposes of the care decision (section 16).  Such decisions couldbe appealed to the administrative courts by both the parents andthe child.      2. During prohibition on removal 39.  On 18 July 1988 the Supreme Administrative Court held that adecision by the Social Council to restrict the access rights of theappellants, Mr and Mrs Olsson, while a prohibition on removal undersection 28 of the Social Services Act was in force had no legaleffect and that no appeal to the administrative courts would lieagainst such a decision.  The court stated:      "Under section 16 of the [1980 Act] ..., a Social Council may     restrict the right of access in respect of children taken into     public care under this Act.  As regards the right of access to     children while a prohibition on removal is in force, no     similar power has been vested in the Social Council in the     relevant legislation.  As there is no legal provision giving     the Social Council power to restrict the right of access     during the validity of the prohibition on     removal ..., the instructions given by the Chairman of the     Social Council in order to limit the right of access have no     legal effect.  Nor can any right of appeal be inferred from     general principles of administrative law or from the European     Convention on Human Rights."      D. New legislation 40.  The provisions of the Social Services Act which related to theprohibition on removal are now contained, in amended form, in the1990 Act containing Special Provisions on the Care of Young Persons(lagen 1990:52 med särskilda bestämmelser om vård av unga - "the1990 Act").  This entered into force on 1 July 1990. 41.  Section 24 of the 1990 Act, which corresponds to the previoussection 28 of the Social Services Act (see paragraph 35 above),provides that the County Administrative Court may, on applicationby the Social Council, impose a prohibition on removal for acertain time or until further notice.  The condition for such aprohibition is that there must be      "an apparent risk (påtaglig risk) that the young person's     health and development will be harmed if he is separated from     the home".      Although this wording differs from that of section 28 of theSocial Services Act, it was not intended, according to thepreparatory work (Prop. 1989/90:28, p. 83), to introduce thereby anew standard. 42.  According to section 26 of the 1990 Act, the Social Councilshall, at least once every three months, consider whether aprohibition on removal is still necessary.  If it is not, it shalllift the prohibition. 43.  Pursuant to section 31, the Social Council may regulate theparent's access to the child if it is necessary in view of thepurposes of the prohibition on removal. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION 44.  In his application of 28 July 1986 to the Commission(no. 12366/86), Mr Rieme alleged that his requests for transfer ofcustody and for termination of the prohibition on removal had notbeen determined "within a reasonable time" by the Swedish courts,as required by Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention.  Moreover,contrary to this provision, he had not received a fair hearing.  Hefurther claimed that the maintenance in force of the prohibition onremoval over such a long period and the absence of an adequateright to access to the child had given rise to a violation of hisright to respect for family life, as guaranteed by Article 8(art. 8).  He invoked, in addition, Article 17 (art. 17). 45.  On 5 July 1989 the Commission declared the complaints underArticle 6 (art. 6) inadmissible and the remainder of theapplication admissible.      In its report of 2 October 1990 (Article 31) (art. 31), theCommission expressed the opinion, by eight votes to five, thatthere had been a violation of Article 8 (art. 8).  The full text ofthe Commission's opinion and of the five separate opinionscontained in the report is reproduced as an annex to thisjudgment*. _______________* Note by the Registrar: for practical reasons this annex willappear only with the printed version of the judgment(volume 226-B of Series A of the Publications of the Court), but acopy of the Commission's report is obtainable from the registry._______________ 46.  The Court notes that the applicant's daughter did not takepart and was not represented in the proceedings before theConvention institutions. FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT 47.  At the hearing on 25 November 1991, the Government confirmedthe final submission in their memorial, inviting the Court to findthat "the facts of the case do not reveal any violation of theConvention". AS TO THE LAW I.   SCOPE OF THE CASE 48.  The applicant raised several issues under Article 6(art. 6) of the Convention (see paragraph 44 above).  However, thecase, as delimited by the Commission's decision on admissibility,concerns only his complaint that the Swedish authorities had actedin a way which hindered reunion with his child, in breach ofArticle 8 (art. 8). 49.  The Government maintained that the Convention institutions'examination under Article 8 (art. 8) should not extend beyond26 March 1986, which is the date of the last decision by a domesticcourt in the case.  The applicant had not availed himself of theopportunity, which was open to him, to institute fresh proceedingsbefore domestic courts and had therefore failed to exhaust domesticremedies in respect of facts which had occurred after that date.Additionally, the Government warned against a tendency ofapplicants not to pursue their claims domestically, once theCommission had declared their application admissible.  Mr Rieme hadnot submitted a fresh request for revocation of the prohibition onremoval until 1 September 1989.  In his case, a decision onadmissibility was taken on 5 July 1989.  On the other hand, theGovernment considered that facts which took place after26 March 1986 were of interest to the extent that they could shedlight on facts before that date. 50.  The Court notes that Mr Rieme did not complain of an isolatedact but rather of a situation in which he had been for some timeand which would continue until it was ended by a decision to liftthe prohibition on removal.  The prohibition applied until furthernotice and, as the Commission observed, apart from the passage oftime, there were no significant new facts which could justify freshproceedings to have it quashed.  Were Article 26 (art. 26) to makemandatory the taking of such steps, which by their very nature maybe repeated an indefinite number of times, it might create apermanent barrier to bringing matters before the Conventioninstitutions (see, inter alia, the Guzzardi v. Italy judgment of6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, pp. 29-30, para. 80). 51.  Furthermore, whilst the Court's jurisdiction in contentiousmatters is determined by the Commission's decision declaring theoriginating application admissible, it is competent, in theinterests of economy of proceedings, to take into account factsoccurring during the course of the proceedings in so far as theyconstitute a continuation of the facts underlying the complaintsdeclared admissible (see, amongst many other authorities, theOlsson v. Sweden judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no. 130, pp.28-29, para. 56). 52.  For these reasons, the Government's preliminary objection isrejected. II.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 (art. 8) 53.  The applicant complained that the Swedish authorities hadhindered his reunion with his daughter Susanne in violation ofArticle 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, which provides:      "1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and     family life, his home and his correspondence.      2.   There shall be no interference by a public authority with     the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance     with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the     interests of national security, public safety or the economic     well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or     crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the     protection of the rights and freedoms of others."      The Government rejected this contention, whereas theCommission agreed that there had been a breach of this provision.     A.    Existence of an interference 54.  The mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other'scompany constitutes a fundamental element of family life, and thenatural family relationship is not terminated by reason of the factthat the child is taken into public care (see, amongst manyauthorities, the Margareta and Roger Andersson v. Sweden judgmentof 25 February 1992, Series A no. 226-A, p. 25, para. 72). 55.  The implementation of the public care order, the subsequentprohibition on removal and its maintenance in force clearlyconstituted, and this was not disputed, an interference with theapplicant's right to respect for family life (see, ibid., and theEriksson v. Sweden judgment of 22 June 1989, Series A no. 156,p. 24, para. 58). 56.  Such an interference constitutes a violation ofArticle 8 (art. 8) unless it was "in accordance with the law", hadan aim or aims that is or are legitimate under Article 8 para. 2(art. 8-2) and was "necessary in a democratic society" for theaforesaid aim or aims (see, for example, the above-mentioned Olssonjudgment, Series A no. 130, p. 29, para. 59).      B. "In accordance with the law" 57.  The applicant made several allegations to the effect that theinterference was not "in accordance with the law".      1. "Substitute placement" 58.  In the applicant's contention, the social welfare authoritieshad, contrary to Swedish law, placed Susanne in the Forsberg familywith the intention that she should never be reunited with him andhad promised them that they would be able "to keep the child forgood".  She had been subjected to so-called "substitute placement"(ersättningsplacering).  This was a practice applied by the socialwelfare authorities in certain cases, whereby it was decided at thevery outset that the placement was to be of a long-lasting orpermanent character (see paragraph 34 above), thus substituting thefoster parents for the natural parents.  As a consequence, littleeffort was made to reunite the child and the natural parents.      In support of his allegation, the applicant relied mainly onan observation made in the custody review of 21 September 1978 (seeparagraph 9 above) that Susanne had become completely integratedinto the foster family and that the Forsberg spouses, who had takenon their role as foster parents fully aware of the realities of thesituation, had been prepared to take care of her for as long asneeded and had accepted the prospect of her staying there untiladulthood.  Furthermore, he referred to a statement in the custodyreview of 27 June 1983 (see paragraph 10 above), according to whichthe foster parents had not considered Susanne a "foster child" -indeed the expression had not even been used in their home.Moreover, they had stated that they had not known at the outset howlong Susanne's placement with them would last but that it had nowbecome permanent.  In addition, the applicant pointed out that thesocial welfare authorities had been opposed to his obtainingcustody of Susanne and had compelled him to have less contact withher pending the two above-mentioned custody reviews.  These reviews- which had lasted for nine months and for one year and threemonths, respectively - had unduly delayed his reunion with thechild.  A further delay of almost a year had been caused by theSocial Council's review of the question of removal (see paragraph13 above), carried out between October 1983 and September 1984, thepurpose of which had been to hinder reunion. 59.  However, in the Court's view, the above does not bear out theallegation that the foster parents were promised that they couldkeep the child.  Nor is there any indication that the socialwelfare authorities acted in a manner inconsistent with Swedishlaw, or with a view to hindering reunion.  On the contrary, asappears from the case-file, they sought to facilitate contactbetween the applicant and his daughter and to enable them to deepentheir relationship (see paragraphs 18, 21 and 22 above).  Theyterminated the public care order in 1984 - shortly after theapplicant received custody of the child - and lifted theprohibition on removal in 1989 (see paragraphs 11-13 and 23-24above).      2. The law relating to prohibition on removal 60.  The applicant did not dispute before the Court that theprohibition on removal had a basis in Swedish law.  However, heargued that the law in question did not afford him adequateprotection against arbitrary interference.  Not only was thecriterion in section 28 of the Social Services Act ("risk ... ofharming the child's ... mental health") vague but also thepreparatory work to this provision (see paragraph 35 above)contained several unrelated and even contradictory criteria. 61.  Like the Government and the Commission, the Court is unable toshare this view, for the reasons expressed in theabove-mentioned Eriksson judgment (Series A no. 156, pp. 24-25,para. 60) in the following terms:      "Section 28 itself is admittedly worded in rather general     terms and confers a wide measure of discretion.  However, it     is scarcely feasible to set out in advance all the     circumstances in which the removal of a child from a foster     home may cause a serious risk of harming his physical or     mental health.  If the authorities' entitlement to act were to     be confined to cases where actual harm had already occurred,     the effectiveness of the protection which the child requires     would be unduly reduced.  Moreover, in interpreting and     applying this section, the relevant preparatory work ...     provides guidance as to the exercise of the discretion it     confers and the administrative courts have competence to     review at several levels the decisions made pursuant to this     section.      Taking these safeguards against arbitrary interferences into     consideration, the scope of the discretion conferred on the     authorities by the section in question appears to the Court to     be reasonable and acceptable for the purposes of Article 8     (art. 8)."      3. Access arrangements 62.  The applicant complained of not having been able to obtain adecision by the social welfare authorities on the regulation ofaccess (see paragraph 13 above).      The Delegate of the Commission, for her part, stressed at theCourt's hearing that if any access restrictions were imposed whilethe prohibition on removal was in force, they would lack a basis indomestic law.  She referred to the above-mentioned Erikssonjudgment (ibid., p. 25, para. 65) where it was held that:      "... the imposition of restrictions on access while a     prohibition on removal is in force has been found by the     Supreme Administrative Court to lack all legal effect as there     are no legal provisions on which any such restrictions could     be based [see paragraph 39 above].  Having regard to this     authoritative interpretation of Swedish law, the Court     concludes that the interference in question with     Mrs Eriksson's right to respect for family life did not have     the requisite basis in domestic law and was therefore not 'in     accordance with the law' for the purposes of Article 8     (art. 8)." 63.  However, the Court notes that in the present case no formaldecision was taken with regard to access while the prohibition onremoval was in force.  Instead, the access arrangements were theresult of co-operation between the applicant, the foster parentsand the social welfare authorities.  Accordingly, access to hisdaughter was gradually stepped up, so as to accommodate not onlyhis own wishes, but also hers (see paragraphs 20-22 above).Consequently, the Court does not find it established that accessarrangements were imposed upon the applicant contrary to Swedishlaw. 64.  Having regard to the above, the Court is satisfied that theinterference was "in accordance with the law".      C. Legitimate aim 65.  The applicant contended that the measures at issue did nothave a legitimate aim for the purposes of Article 8 (art. 8), asthey were taken with a view to preventing reunion between him andthe child. 66.  The Court accepts that the relevant Swedish law was aimed atprotecting the "health" and "the rights and freedoms" of the childand finds no indication that it was applied for any other purposein this instance (see paragraph 59 above).  The interference thushad aims that were legitimate under Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2).      D. "Necessary in a democratic society" 67.  In the applicant's main submission, the social welfareauthorities had acted in a way calculated to hinder his reunionwith the child.  In particular, the decision to prohibit removaland its maintenance in force for over five years were not"necessary in a democratic society".  He had been unable to haveadequate access to the child.  Nor had it been possible for him toobtain a decision regulating access, despite having requested thisin connection with the termination of public care in 1984 (seeparagraph 13 above).  As a consequence of the latter, no courtremedy had been available to him in respect of the accessarrangements (see paragraph 39 above). 68.  On this latter point, the Court recalls that during the periodin question the access arrangements were the result ofco-operation (see paragraph 63 above). 69.  The notion of necessity implies that the interference must beproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued; in determining whetheran interference is "necessary in a democratic society", the Courtwill take into account that a margin of appreciation is to be leftto the Contracting States (see, amongst many authorities, theabove-mentioned Eriksson judgment, Series A no. 156, p. 26,para. 69).      Furthermore, it must be recalled that in cases like thepresent a father's right to respect for family life underArticle 8 (art. 8) includes a right to the taking of measures witha view to his being reunited with the child (see the above-mentioned Eriksson judgment, Series A no. 156, pp. 26-27,para. 71, and the above-mentioned Margareta and Roger Anderssonjudgment, Series A no. 226-A, p. 30, para. 91). 70.  In the Social Council's decision of 16 October 1984 and thesubsequent judgments upholding it (see paragraphs 13-17 above), thereasons for the prohibition on removal were essentially thatSusanne - who was a very sensitive, fragile and vulnerable person - suffered from psychosomatic problems.  She had been staying withthe Forsberg family since an early age and had become deeply rootedin that environment, where she felt secure and at home in allrespects.  Separating her from this family would have led to toomany stressful changes for her and involved a risk of aggravatingher problems.  It was therefore in her best interests to remainwith the Forsberg family and to develop her contacts with theapplicant in a gradual way.  All these factors, on balance,outweighed the applicant's interest in being reunited with her. 71.  The Court, like the Government and the Commission, issatisfied that these reasons were relevant and sufficient; theyprovided a valid justification for the prohibition on removal andits maintenance in force, at least up to 26 March 1986, when theSupreme Administrative Court refused leave to appeal.  Inparticular, having regard to the Swedish authorities' margin ofappreciation, the interference complained of was notdisproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. 72.  As to the period after that date, the Commission consideredthat, although they could not be said to have acted againstreunion, the social welfare authorities had failed to promote itactively, as they were required to do.  Moreover, taking intoaccount the transitional character of the kind of measure at issue,its long duration in the present case could only be justified invery special circumstances.  The fact that the child had - at thetime when the public care order was lifted and the prohibition onremoval imposed - spent as much as seven years in the foster home,and this since the age of one, militated in favour of a longertransitional period than otherwise.  However, while the prohibitionon removal was in force, the applicant did not have any legalpossibility to secure greater access.  In view of these factors,the Commission found that the interference was disproportionate tothe legitimate aims pursued; it was not "necessary in a democraticsociety", notwithstanding Sweden's margin of appreciation, tomaintain the prohibition for over five years. 73.  The Court has come to a different conclusion.  As fromMay 1986, Susanne stayed overnight every other weekend at theapplicant's home and spent several holidays with him and his wifeduring the remainder of the period in issue (see paragraph 21above).   The measures taken in order to create closer contactsbetween the applicant and his daughter had, as appears from theSocial Council's memorandum of 15 December 1987 (see paragraph 22above), consisted mainly of providing support to Susanne and thefoster home to make her contacts with him as natural as possible.She had been living in the foster home since an early age and hadstrong emotional ties with the foster parents.  In view of her ageand maturity, the relationship with her father was to evolve at herown pace. 74.  The applicant's contention that the social welfare authoritiesintended to hinder reunion is, as already pointed out,unsubstantiated.  Unlike in the Eriksson case (Series A no. 156,pp. 26-27, paras. 71-72), the Court sees no ground for criticisingtheir conduct in the present instance. 75.  At all times the Swedish authorities acted within the law.Having regard to their margin of appreciation, they cannot be saidnot to have had relevant and sufficient reasons for keeping thechild in the foster home during the period in question. 76.  Consequently, the Court does not find that the prohibition onremoval lasted for longer than could reasonably be thoughtnecessary. 77.  Accordingly, there has been no violation of Article 8(art. 8). FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY 1.   Dismisses the Government's preliminary plea as to the scope of     the case; 2.   Holds that there has been no violation of Article 8     (art. 8).
