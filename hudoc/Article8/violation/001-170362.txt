Paragraph 3 of Chapter II entitled “Final and Transitional Provisions”, provided, inter alia, that on the day of the Act’s entry into force, the powers of the current members of the HCJ, except for the Minister of Justice and the Prosecutor General, were terminated and that the new composition of the HCJ must be formed in accordance with the law.D.
Recent amendments to domestic law115.
On 2 June 2016 Parliament adopted amendments to the Constitution regarding the judiciary (which took effect on 30 September 2016, except for a provision concerning the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, which will take effect three years after the publication of the amendments). On the same day Parliament adopted the new law on judiciary and the status of judges (which took effect on 30 September 2016, except for certain transitional provisions which took effect earlier). The explanatory notes to both draft laws stated that the legislature had incorporated all the key recommendations made in relation to those draft laws by the European Commission for Democracy through Law (“the Venice Commission”). Those recommendations concerned the principles of the formation and functioning of the bodies responsible for the judicial profession; ensuring that judicial appointments and dismissals were depoliticised; as well as strengthening the independence of the judiciary.116.
The “Final and Transitional Provisions” of the Act introducing the amendments to the Constitution provided that following its entry into force, the termination of powers and the dismissal of judges must be conducted in accordance with those amendments to the Constitution; the powers of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecutor General as members of the HCJ were terminated; the other members of the HCJ would exercise, for the period of their office, the functions of members of the new High Council of Justice (Вища рада правосуддя); in any case, however, their term of office would expire on 30 April 2019.THE LAWI.
JOINDER OF THE APPLICATIONS117.
Having regard to the similarity of the applications, the Court decided that, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the applications should be joined in accordance with Rule 42 § 1 of the Rules of Court.II.
ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 6 AND 8 OF THE CONVENTION118.
Relying on Article 6 of the Convention, the applicants complained that their dismissal proceedings had been unfair and incompatible with the principle of an independent and impartial tribunal. Some of the applicants also complained, referring either expressly or in substance to Article 8 of the Convention, that their private lives had been substantially affected by their dismissals.119.
Having regard to the findings in the case of Oleksandr Volkov v. Ukraine ( no. 21722/11, §§ 165-87, ECHR 2013), the Court decided that, for the sake of a uniform approach and equal protection of human rights, the complaint under Article 8 of the Convention should be examined in all the applications.120.
The relevant parts of Article 6 § 1 and Article 8 of the Convention provide as follows:Article 6 (right to a fair hearing)“In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ... everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.”Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life)“1.
Everyone has the right to respect for his private ... life ... .2.
There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”A.
Admissibility1.
The parties’ submissions121.
The Government referred to the Court’s findings in the case of Oleksandr Volkov (cited above, §§ 123-30), and submitted that all the applicants had not been obliged to challenge the decisions on their dismissals before the courts because such proceedings would not ensure an effective review of their cases. The Government maintained that all the applicants had missed the six-month deadline for applying to the Court, which had to be calculated from the date of the HCJ’s decisions in their cases.122.
The applicants disagreed and argued that their complaints were admissible.2.
The Court’s assessment(a)
As to the exhaustion of domestic remedies123.
The Court notes that certain applicants failed either to properly apply for judicial review or to take all the steps required in order to complete judicial review at the domestic level. The Government did not submit any objection as regards the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, considering instead that judicial review was ineffective. They made their objection based on the six-month rule, which is examined below. The Court reiterates that the scope of review of an applicant’s compliance with the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies is limited by the Government’s objections (see, for example, Kotiy v. Ukraine, no. 28718/09, § 37, 5 March 2015). It follows that the applications concerned cannot be rejected on the ground that domestic remedies have not been exhausted.(b)
As to the Government’s objection based on the six-month rule124.
As noted above, the Government submitted that the six-month rule laid down in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention had to be counted from the date of the HCJ decisions in the applicants’ cases because judicial review of their cases would not constitute an effective remedy.125.
The Court reiterates that as a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where it is clear from the outset, however, that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant. Where an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate, for the purposes of Article 35 § 1, to take the start of the six-month period as the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, § 157, ECHR 2009, with further references).126.
The decisions of the HCJ and Parliament on the applicants’ dismissals were open to appeal in the domestic courts. Even though the Court subsequently criticised those review proceedings in the case of Oleksandr Volkov (cited above, §§ 123-30), it cannot be argued that at the relevant time it was clear for the applicants that the available judicial review had been ineffective and should not have been pursued. On the contrary, the Court considers that where the applicants tried to settle their cases by way of available domestic judicial review, those attempts cannot be held against them (see, mutatis mutandis, Voloshyn v. Ukraine, no. 15853/08, § 42, 10 October 2013). In such cases the applicants reasonably waited for the completion of the court proceedings, even though they might not have met the requirements of effectiveness under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Kaverzin v. Ukraine, no. 23893/03, § 99, 15 May 2012).127.
These considerations are equally pertinent to some of the applicants, who were waiting for the outcome of the proceedings in which the court reviewed only the parliamentary resolution on dismissal. Those applicants were reasonably entitled to assume that such resolutions were decisive for the termination of their employment. Indeed, in the absence of a parliamentary resolution on dismissal, there was no dismissal as such; a judge continued to work, despite the negative decision of the HCJ, and it could not be argued that his or her case had been finally determined. Accordingly, in the context of the six-month rule, those applicants cannot be reproached for having challenged the final decision in the process of their dismissal and having waited for the outcome of the relevant proceedings.128.
The Court therefore dismisses the Government’s objection under this head. It further notes that no other issues as to the six-month rule arise with the exception of one application addressed below.(c)
Otherwise as to the six-month rule in the application of Mr Kormushyn (no. 68443/11)129.
The Court reiterates that, where an applicant is entitled to be served ex officio with a written copy of the final domestic decision, the object and purpose of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention are best served by counting the six-month period as running from the date of service of the written judgment, whereas in cases where the domestic law does not provide for service, the Court considers it appropriate to take the date the decision was finalised as the starting-point, that being when the parties were definitely able to be informed of its content (see, among others, Oğuz v. Turkey (dec.), no. 14040/10, § 31, 5 November 2013, with further references). Where the court publicly pronounced the operative part of the final decision and gave a brief oral explanation of its reasons, but the applicant could familiarise himself with the written grounds for the decision only subsequently, that later date was taken as a starting point for the calculation of the six-month period (see Piętka v. Poland, no. 34216/07, §§ 44-46, 16 October 2012).130.
Mr Kormushyn alleged that on 6 April 2011 the HAC had pronounced only the introductory and operative parts of its decision, that the letter with the full text of the decision had been sent to him on 5 May 2011 and that he had received it on 7 May 2011.131.
Having regard to the evidence produced by the applicant and to the absence of any submissions by the Government refuting that evidence, the Court gives credence to the applicant’s allegation and considers that he did not have sufficient knowledge of the grounds and reasons for the final decision in his case until 7 May 2011. Accordingly, that date should be taken as the starting point for the calculation of the six-month period. Given that the application was introduced on 26 October 2011, the applicant did not miss the six-month deadline.(d)
Conclusion132.
The Court notes that the above-mentioned complaints made by the applicants are not manifestly ill‑founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible.B.
Merits133.
The applicants maintained their complaints.134.
The Government did not comment on the merits.1.
Article 6 § 1 of the Convention135.
With regard to the complaints under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the domestic bodies dealing with the applicants’ cases lacked independence and impartiality, the Court refers to its findings in Oleksandr Volkov (cited above, §§ 109-31). In that case, it concluded that the procedure before the HCJ and Parliament had disclosed a number of structural and general shortcomings which had compromised the principles of independence and impartiality, and that the subsequent judicial review had not remedied those shortcomings. The Court considers that those findings are equally relevant to the present applications.136.
The Court notes that in the applications of Mr Korzachenko (no. 4588/11) and Mr Kovzel (no. 35336/11) the HCJ’s decisions were submitted to the President of Ukraine, not to Parliament, for a final decision on the applicants’ dismissals. Where that part of the decision-making process was entrusted to the President of the State, who had vast executive powers, it does not appear that that stage of the domestic procedure ensured the basic guarantees of judicial process typically required by Article 6 of the Convention. The Court considers that this distinctive feature in the intermediary stage of the complex domestic procedure does not affect the overall conclusion that the principles of independence and impartiality were not ensured at domestic level.137.
The Court holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in respect of all the applicants as regards non-compliance with the principles of independence and impartiality.2.
Article 8 of the Convention138.
The Court has to determine whether the applicants’ dismissals violated their right to respect for private life. In Oleksandr Volkov (cited above, §§ 166-67 and 173-85) the Court found that the applicant’s dismissal from the post of judge had constituted an interference with his private life and that such interference did not comply with the requirements of “quality of law” and was not therefore lawful for the purpose of Article 8 of the Convention. Those findings are relevant to the present applications and there is no reason to depart from them.139.
There has therefore been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in respect of all the applicants.III.
OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION140.
The applicants raised other complaints. In particular, relying on various Convention provisions, some of the applicants made the following complaints: their right of access to court had been unfairly restricted; the proceedings had been too lengthy; the principles of legal certainty, equality of arms, “tribunal established by law” and the public consideration of the case had not been respected; the decisions in their cases had been unlawful, and had not been properly reasoned and substantiated; their right to an effective remedy had not been ensured; their property rights had been violated; their dismissal had breached their right to express opinions; the authorities had failed to comply with the principle of ne bis in idem; and the dismissal proceedings had been discriminatory.141.
Having regard to the facts of the case, the submissions of the parties and the above findings under Article 6 § 1 and Article 8 of the Convention, the Court considers that the main legal questions in the present applications have been determined. It holds, therefore, that there is no need to give a separate ruling on the remaining complaints (see, among other authorities, Varnava and Others, cited above, §§ 210 - 211, and Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v. Romania [GC], no. 47848/08, § 156, ECHR 2014, with further references).IV.
APPLICATION OF ARTICLES 41 AND 46 OF THE CONVENTION142.
Article 41 of the Convention provides:“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”143.
Article 46 of the Convention provides:“1. The High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the final judgment of the Court in any case to which they are parties.2. The final judgment of the Court shall be transmitted to the Committee of Ministers, which shall supervise its execution. ...”A.
General and individual measures144.
Relying on Oleksandr Volkov (cited above, §§ 199-202 and §§ 205‑208), some of the applicants requested the Court to indicate to the Government the need to introduce general measures to reform the system of judicial discipline in Ukraine, as well as to take the individual measure of ordering their reinstatement.145.
The Government submitted that considerable legislative steps had been taken to reform the system of judicial discipline in Ukraine. They argued that after the events of February 2014, leading to an extraordinary change in State power in Ukraine, there had been a positive tendency towards protection of human rights and, in particular, the rights of judges. As an example, they referred to the case of Mr Kovzel (application no. 35336/11), who had been reinstated in his position. The Government suggested that they could therefore settle the issues of individual measures themselves.146.
As to the general measures, the Court considers that following its ruling on general measures in Oleksandr Volkov, there is no call to make any similar ruling in the present case. The applicants’ request concerning general measures is therefore dismissed.147.
As regards the individual measure requested, namely the reinstatement of the applicants, in many cases where the domestic proceedings were found to be in breach of the Convention, the Court has held that the most appropriate form of reparation for the violations found would be the reopening of the domestic proceedings (see for example, Huseyn and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 35485/05, 45553/05, 35680/05 and 36085/05, § 262, 26 July 2011, with further references). In Oleksandr Volkov the Court considered that the reopening of the domestic proceedings was not an adequate measure. Having regard to the circumstances giving rise to the violations and the necessity of an extensive reform of the system of judicial discipline, the Court concluded in that case that there were no grounds to assume that the applicant’s case would be retried in accordance with the principles of the Convention in the near future and indicated to the Government that they had to secure the applicant’s reinstatement (see Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, §§ 207 and 208).148.
The Court notes that at the present time a full-fledged judicial reform is taking place in Ukraine which includes constitutional and further legislative amendments, as well as institutional changes. Against this background, the Court is not in a position to assess the effectiveness at the moment of the procedure for the reopening of the domestic proceedings, if requested by the applicants. However, given the scope and the circumstances of the present applications, it cannot be concluded that this substantially new background renders the relevant domestic procedures prima facie futile and useless. The Court does not therefore follow the approach taken in Oleksandr Volkov (ibid., § 208) as to the indication of an individual measure and dismisses the relevant request.B.
Damage1.
Pecuniary damage149.
Most of the applicants claimed various amounts in respect of pecuniary damage, arguing that they had lost earnings and benefits, including pensions, to which they would be entitled upon reaching retirement age.150.
As regards the claim for past loss, the Government considered that some of the claims were entirely unsubstantiated and that others contained wrong calculations or lacked evidence. They further invited the Court to dismiss the claims for any future loss, arguing that that part of the claims was entirely hypothetical and speculative. In that regard, the Government referred to İlhan v. Turkey ([GC], no. 22277/93, § 109, ECHR 2000‑VII), in which the applicant’s claim for compensation of future medical expenses was dismissed.151.
The Court reiterates that there must be a clear causal connection between the damage claimed by the applicants and the violation of the Convention. In appropriate cases, this may include compensation in respect of loss of earnings (see Kurić and Others v. Slovenia (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 26828/06, § 81, ECHR 2014). In the present case, the Court has found that the domestic proceedings for the applicants’ dismissals were in breach of the Convention. There is therefore a sufficient causal link between those violations of the Convention and the applicants’ loss of earnings.152.
Questions remain, firstly, as to the method used by the applicants to determine the amounts of compensation claimed in respect of pecuniary damage and, secondly, as to the evidence submitted in support of the claims.153.
The Court notes that a precise calculation of the sums necessary to make complete reparation (restitutio in integrum) in respect of the pecuniary losses suffered by an applicant may be prevented by the inherently uncertain character of the damage flowing from the violation. An award may still be made notwithstanding the large number of imponderables involved in the assessment of future losses, though the greater the lapse of time involved, the more uncertain the link between the breach and the damage becomes. The question to be decided in such cases is the level of just satisfaction, in respect of either past or future pecuniary loss, to be awarded to an applicant, which is a matter to be determined by the Court at its discretion, having regard to what is equitable (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 171, ECHR 2005‑VII).154.
The applicants based their calculation on the assumption that they would work until retirement age, after which they would be entitled to a pension. However, various eventualities impairing that assumption (for example, incapacity to work, dismissal, demotion, change of salary or pension rates) were not considered. Secondly, following dismissal the applicants were not prevented from taking up new employment, even though their dismissal records imposed certain limitations and might have had a negative impact on their prospects of finding new jobs. Meanwhile, the income received after the dismissal, as a result of new employment or obtained otherwise, would have to be examined and taken into account when determining the amount of pecuniary loss actually caused by the dismissal. In that regard, the Court observes that some of the applicants, in quantifying their pecuniary loss, submitted information on the earnings they had received from their new employment after their dismissal. Finally, the applicants’ opportunities of reinstatement, mentioned above, substantially affect their estimate of the future loss.155.
Having examined the submissions by the parties and the available evidence, the Court, ruling on an equitable basis, awards 8,000 euros (EUR) to Ms L. Vasina in respect of pecuniary losses incurred between 2012 and 2014 (inclusively). The Court dismisses the remaining claims for pecuniary damage on the grounds that they are unsubstantiated and speculative.2.
Non-pecuniary damage156.
Most of the applicants claimed various amounts in respect of non‑pecuniary damage. The Government objected to those claims, arguing that they were unfounded. The Court considers that the applicants must have sustained non-pecuniary damage which the finding of violations of the Convention in this judgment does not suffice to remedy. The Court, ruling on an equitable basis, makes awards to those applicants who submitted claims under this head as specified in Appendix II.C.
Costs and expenses157.
The majority of the applicants also claimed the reimbursement of the costs and expenses incurred before the Court.158.
The Government submitted that the claims were excessive.159.
According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court finds it reasonable to make the followings awards:(a) the eleven applicants represented by the European Human Rights Advocacy Centre based in London (“the EHRAC”), as specified in Appendix II, should be awarded jointly EUR 11,000 for costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the Court;(b) Ms L. Vasina should be awarded EUR 600 for costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the Court.160.
The amounts awarded under this head are to be paid directly into the bank accounts of the applicants’ representatives (see, for example, Hristovi v. Bulgaria, no. 42697/05, § 109, 11 October 2011, and Singartiyski and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 48284/07, § 54, 18 October 2011).D.
Default interest161.
The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT, UNANIMOUSLY,1.
Decides to join the applications; 2.
Declares the complaints under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (as regards the principles of independent and impartial tribunal) admissible; 3.
Declares the complaints under Article 8 of the Convention (as regards respect for private life) admissible; 4.
Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention with respect to all the applicants as regards non-compliance with the principles of independence and impartiality; 5.
Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention with respect to all the applicants; 6.
Holds that it is not necessary to examine the admissibility and merits of the other complaints; 7.
Holds(a)
that the respondent State is to pay the applicants, within three months of the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the amounts stated in Appendix II, plus any tax that may be chargeable to them, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;(b)
that the amounts awarded in respect of costs and expenses shall be paid into the bank accounts of the applicants’ representatives;(c)
that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement, simple interest shall be payable on such amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points; 8.
Dismisses the remainder of the applicants’ claims for just satisfaction.Done in English, and notified in writing on 19 January 2017, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.Milan BlaškoAngelika NußbergerDeputy RegistrarPresident   Appendix I Application no. and the applicant’s nameYear of the applicant’s birthPlace of the applicant’s residenceDate of introduction5114/09Andriy Volodymyrovych KULYKOV1967Dnipro21/12/20084588/11 Volodymyr Mykolayovych KORZACHENKO1976Obukhiv13/01/20119740/11Oleg Volodymyrovych BACHUN1960Kyiv8/02/201112812/11Sergiy Mykhaylovych KONYAKIN1962Holovanivsk11/02/201120554/11Lyudmyla Ivanivna STASOVSKA1958Kamyanske20/03/201135336/11Petro Olegovych KOVZEL1970Kyiv6/06/201168443/11Kyrylo Oleksandrovych KORMUSHYN1979Kyiv26/10/201175790/11Liliya Anatoliyivna VASINA1958Dnipro01/12/201178241/11Igor Ivanovych BARANENKO1969Kyiv16/12/20115678/12Igor Anatoliyovych BONDARENKO1967Boryspil20/01/201211775/12Nina Dmytrivna BABYCH1972Kyiv23/02/201221546/12Oleksandr Mykolayovych ROZDOBUDKO1964Berezan04/04/201254135/12Lidiya Volodymyrivna TOKAR1956Vinnytsya18/08/201265207/12 Oleksandr Anatoliyovych SHKINDER1962Henichensk22/09/201277810/12 Aleksandr Ivanovich VOLVENKO1967Henichensk17/10/2012242/13Yuriy Oleksiyovych STREBKOV1967Henichensk29/11/201215073/13Gennadiy Leonidovych NEMYNUSHCHIY1963Slovyansk22/02/201357154/13Nataliya Grygorivha SEREDNYA1978Kryvyy Rih27/08/2013   Appendix II  Application no. and the applicant’s nameRepresented byAward in respect of pecuniary damage Award in respect of non-pecuniary damageAward in respect of costs and expenses 5114/09Andriy Volodymyrovych KULYKOVNo representative0 00 4588/11 Volodymyr Mykolayovych KORZACHENKONo representative05,00009740/11Oleg Volodymyrovych BACHUNthe EHRAC05,000See paragraph 159 (a) of the judgment12812/11Sergiy Mykhaylovych KONYAKINNo representative00020554/11Lyudmyla Ivanivna STASOVSKAThe EHRAC05,000See paragraph 159 (a) of the judgment35336/11Petro Olegovych KOVZELThe EHRAC05,000See paragraph 159 (a) of the judgment68443/11Kyrylo Oleksandrovych KORMUSHYNThe EHRAC05,000See paragraph 159 (a) of the judgment75790/11Liliya Anatoliyivna VASINAI.
